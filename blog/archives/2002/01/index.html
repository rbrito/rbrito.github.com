<p>Well, some progress on the PPC front. I've just configured the PMac
to use the <code>imstt</code> driver instead of the <code>fbdev</code>. Due to this, the
X server is now <em>much</em> faster. In fact, the whole computer is much
faster. Before, it spent a lot of processing power just to update
the screen. Since it is not exactly the most powerful computer in
the world, those few moments indeed were important.</p>

<p>It is very fast and now it is almost able to play AVI files with
MPlayer. Almost.</p>

<p>This Mac is now very usable and I'd even dare to say that it would
be a good workstation, were it not that outdated (well, if one
could find replacement hardware for it easily...)</p>

<p>I think that'll end summarizing all the "Mac Journey" in a homepage
to save future souls enduring the problems that I've experienced
(kernel configuration file, XF86Config file etc). It seems that
Linux running on PPC is indeed a quite nice alternative to paying
huge prices just for being able to run MacOS 9.</p>

<p>Also installed the superb
<a href="http://www.mosfet.org/liquid.html">Liquid Theme</a> for KDE2. It's
amazingly beautiful and quite fast, despite all the eye-candy. It
makes your Linux desktop seem like you are running
<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>'s
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">MacOS X's Acqua</a>.</p>

<p>On the down side of things, I guess that I'm just encountering many
aspects of Perl that I don't like. It's saddening that I've spent
so much time and money (buying books) for something that I'm not
really enjoying (but it's ok).</p>
