<p>Got up late (3pm) and went to the shopping mall intending to see
Kubrick's "AI", but got there after the session had already
started. Since we had to leave soon, we opted to see "O Dom da
Premonição" ("The Gift") which was one of the few movies that I
have seen lately that was actually a bit scary. And it was quite
worth the price of admission.</p>

<p>Finally, the text that I have been writing for some time now was
submitted for the Qualifying Examination of my Master's Degree!
This is a landmark in my career and many doors may be open for me
now, with many more professional possibilities. It also means that
I'll soon be having to present my work.</p>

<p>So I have already downloaded the whole
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice suite</a> for Linux, which
enables me to make presentations compatible with Microsoft's
Powerpoint without ever touching Microsoft software. OpenOffice has
already reached the beta status and I think that now is the time to
give it a try.</p>

<p>Went to the shopping mall and later to the supermarket with my
sweet girlfriend and bought CDs that I found in the bargain bin for
only R$ 2.80 a piece. Got Paul Dianno's solo CD in the bunch.</p>

<p>A busy day working -- lots of phone calls helping a customer to get
his Windows 2000 working correctly with IP routing. Then (on the
bright side), made the Linux boxes of another customer's
<a href="http://www.netlink.psi.br">ISP</a> work well with Radius
authentication services. Unfortunately, we could not test it, but
everything there looks good. We'll see tomorrow if there are any
complaints.</p>

<p>BTW, <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE 2.2.1</a> was released today. That's
great, since it is a quite advanced Desktop Environment for Linux
available now and is way more polished than
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> is, at least IMO. It will hit
<a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/sid/">sid</a> in some days and soon
will be in <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/woody/">woody</a> (I
hope).</p>

<p>Lots of new things in the Debian incoming repository: KDE 2.2.1,
KOffice 1.1, Broadcast 2000, dillo, and Java 1.3. Woohoo!</p>
