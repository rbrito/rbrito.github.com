<div class="inlinecontent">

<p>Some weeks ago, my uncle that sells and fixes computers,
<a href="mailto:startmicro@uol.com.br">Isaac</a>, got a pair of old
<a href="http://www.info.apple.com/applespec/applespec.taf?RID=204">Power Macintosh 9500/180MP</a>
from a customer. His customer said that if he fixed one of them,
the other would be his as payment. So he kind of fixed one of them
and lent me the other, which means that I'm now going to play with
both
<a href="http://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/English-North_American/Macintosh/System/Mac_OS_8.1_Update/">MacOS 8.0</a>
and a Unix-like OS with it.</p>

<p>It came with two PowerPC 604e processors of 180MHz (or so the specs
say), 64MB of RAM (where am I going to get more of it?), an
<a href="http://www.ati.com">ATI</a> graphics card with 2MB of memory, and a
4-speed CD-ROM. It features two SCSI interfaces, an Ethernet
adapter, a MacOS 8.0 CD, a keyboard and the (in)famous 1-button
mouse from <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>.</p>

<p>It is the first dual-head machine over which I am able to get my
greasy pawls. As welcome additionals, it is also the first time I
get to play with a non-x86 machine in a System Administrator
position (of course, I also use Solaris 2.x with
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/">my University's</a> workstations, but that
doesn't count, since I'm just a luser there).</p>

<p>The PowerPC machines are actually quite different from their ix86
counterparts. First of all, they don't have a BIOS setup, but you
can interface with the hardware before any Operating System gets
loaded with
<a href="http://playground.sun.com/1275/home.html">Open Firmware</a>, which is
written in FORTH. You should be able to get into OF pressing
Command-Option-O-F while the machine chimes, or right after it
chimes. But, to be honest, I still couldn't see the damned OF
prompt, despite my numerous attempts and ways of pressing the
combination of keys.</p>

<p>Anyway, the first task to make it work would, obviously, be to
install MacOS 8.0 on this machine. Well, this sounds great, but my
experience with it is a tiny bit different.</p>

<p>The first of the problems is that the machine doesn't boot while
the HD is connected to it. Weird, huh? I agree. If, on the other
hand, I disconnect the machine, put the MacOS CD on the CD drive,
let MacOS start loading and <em>immediately</em> plug the power connector
on the HD, <em>then</em> the machine will boot MacOS and see the HD,
partition it and I am able to install MacOS on it. But on the next
reboot, I am not able to get things working without disconnecting
the power of the HD again.</p>

<p>Conformed to be working with the machine this way, I downloaded a
huge load of ISO images for it, including the
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/">NetBSD port for PPC</a>, the
<a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/powerpc/">Debian 2.2r3 port for PPC</a>,
<a href="http://www.linuxppc.org">LinuxPPC 2000 Q4</a> and
<a href="http://www.yellowdoglinux.com">Yellow Dog Linux 2.0</a>. I made sure
the images I downloaded all had the right MD5SUMs and even used
rsync on the images after I had downloaded them, just to make sure
everything got alright.</p>

<p>Well, of all those images, the only one that booted on the Apple
was the <a href="http://www.linuxppc.org">LinuxPPC 2000 Q4 image</a>, which
was quite frustrating. The Debian CDs that I burned (I burned two:
one from a US site and another with non-US programs) didn't even
boot, including boot floppies generated from them -- quite a shame,
since that is, by far, my preferred operating system.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to LinuxPPC. Seeing the machine boot with a
framebuffer with that little penguin holding a mug of beer and
telling me many things about the hardware that I didn't even know
is actually quite refreshing (no pun intended). After the kernel
boots, an X installer is started, a little menu appears and
things... ...STOP! That's right. After investigating a bit, I
discovered that programs are segfaulting consistenly in a reboot,
but in different reboots, the applications that segfault are not
necessarily the same that segfaulted in previous reboots. This may
be a hint that its memory is not OK, although I'm not so sure.</p>

<p>Anyway, I subscribed to the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/#debian-powerpc">Debian PowerPC mailing list</a>
and I have been following it daily, learning a lot of things about
PPC in general.</p>

<p>My faith is restored now that
<a href="http://penguinppc.org/~eb/">Ethan Benson</a> has posted CVS-snapshots
of the woody boot floppies on his page <em>AND</em>, with them, I <strong>can</strong>
boot my machine.</p>

<p>I still have those problems with the HD, although its days are
counted on this machine: I'll be soon getting a 2GB SCSI HD for it
(I hope!), so that I can continue my journey of installing Debian
potato/woody (or any other operating system!) on this machine. I
can't wait to have the beautiful <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE 2.2</a>,
the highly anticipated <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Mozilla</a> and the
amazing <a href="http://www.qmail.org/">qmail</a> running on this machine
(things that this machine designers never dreamt of running on this
old machine).</p>

<p>Oh, what a day! I was <em>so</em> tired that I woke up at (almost) 5pm.
And, surprise: no light. Yes, a power outage. Anyway, my parents
weren't at home and I found a note that mom left on my computer's
keyboard telling me that they were shopping around. Then, I
discovered two new boxes at home: a brand new TV set and a new VCR.
The first time in 5 or 6 months that would be able to see my
amazing tape of <a href="http://www.opeth.com">Opeth</a> playing at Milwaukee
Metalfest. Woohoo.</p>

<p>But without power, my main concern was to be able to <em>see</em> anything
before the day became too dark. After half an hour (or was it an
hour?) trying to find some candles and fire, my parents arrived and
two hours later, I was watching "As Good As It Gets". Cool movie,
BTW. Excellent acting of both Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson (mom
told me that I act like him most of the time -- is that
compliment?).</p>

<p>Busy day. Woke up as soon as possible to see
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~jose/">my advisor</a> and decide the furture
of my Master's degree. Then, at almost 4pm, had a ridicule lunch,
met my girlfriend and went to a shopping mall with her. While I was
there, I was attacked by the capitalist bug and had to buy me
something. I was looking for some <a href="http://www.ora.com">O'Reilly</a>
books, but they were way too expensive (I was expecting to get a
<a href="http://perl.ora.com">Perl</a> book or
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lpython/">Learning Python</a>, but
decided not to).</p>

<p>I talked to the salesman and asked if he had
<a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~damian/">Damian Conway's</a>
<a href="http://www.manning.com/Conway/">Object Oriented Perl</a>, but he told
me <em>"the printing was cancelled"</em>. I told him that
<a href="http://www.manning.com">Manning Publications</a> wasn't told about
that and got some garbage as a response that I didn't even make an
effort to save in any part of my brain.</p>

<p>Since I had the mission to buy myself something, I got me
<a href="http://www.blind-guardian.com">Blind Guardian</a>'s "Nightfall in
Middle Earth". Wonderful.</p>

<p>To finish my day, I went to my uncle's store and got another SCSI
HD for the Powermac, but it was also defective. But now I'm a lot
more confident that the problem isn't with the mac itself, but with
the HDs (the mac would boot with the HD attached and see it while
in MacOS 8, but trying to install it on the HD evidenced that the
head was hitting the platters -- tomorrow I'll be getting another
SCSI HD). Let me cross my fingers. If I actually install Linux on
it, I'll grab <a href="http://www.penguinppc.org/~benh/">BenH</a>'s 2.4.6
Linux and get "my" mac a fresh kernel.</p>

<p>Oh, NetBSD 1.5.1
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Releases/formal-1.5/NetBSD-1.5.1.html">is released</a>.
I still can't get ISO images, though.</p>

<p>This is the day that shouldn't have happened --- it was bad right
from start. First of all, I couldn't sleep well because I dreamt
with some perl scripts that didn't work and they took me almost all
my sleep time (or so it seemed). Then, my kind neighbor started
making lots of noises and I couldn't keep sleeping.</p>

<p>But the worst part of the day was still coming.</p>

<p>I went to my uncle's shop to get a new SCSI HD and he lent me a 4GB
one, more than enough to hold both Linux and MacOS 8. I turned the
thing on and it started making noises like the one I used
yesterday, which wasn't good. Anyway, I left it on and decided to
install MacOS on it. It was progressing nicely and I was getting
happier and happier, but then the whole system froze. I turned the
power off and tried to install Linux. At least this time Linux saw
the HD and all partitions that it had (7, I think).</p>

<p>To install Linux, I used some CVS bootfloppies that will become
bootfloppies of Debian woody. While trying to make the brand new
ext2 filesystem, I got a kernel panic. I tried again. This time, I
went up to the point of choosing which kernel modules I wanted. I
was getting happy again. But then, when I chose the module for the
ethernet card, a new kernel panic. Ouch!</p>

<p>I then tried to install MacOS again and a new freeze. Tried again,
new freeze. Then, I noticed that the HD was getting hot and put a
fan near it. I don't know if it was coincidence or not, but after
that, I could finish the installation of MacOS. Ok, so time to boot
this thing with no CDs in the CD-ROM drive. Nothing. Grrrr.</p>

<p>Things got strange after I tried to put the Linux PPC CD that I had
burned and it didn't work. Washed the CD and no boot. But it did
some days ago! It was not scratched, had no fingerprints and was
absolutely clean. But couldn't boot. I tried using the floppies
again, but this time, another surprise: the HD <em>was</em> recognized,
but a partition scan timed out, Linux told that it could not read
read its beginning and that it assumed that the size of the HD was
1GB, and showed <em>no</em> partitions on the drive. On the other hand,
MacOS is able to see it just before formatting it, perhaps because
it re-scans the SCSI bus. Changing the SCSI-id of the drive didn't
help. Is that the reason why it can't boot from the HD? Perhaps.</p>

<p>Anyway, my desire of seeing this thing encoding MP3s, using KDE, a
brand new browser and typing some texts with LaTeX seems a bit
farther than what I realized at first. I will still keep trying to
make this damn thing work, but I'm not confident anymore that I'll
succeed. Well, I'll talk to my uncle tomorrow, perhaps and see if
the other Mac behaves the same way. Enough for a day already.</p>

<p>Ok, I know I messed up. My girlfriend told me that we were in July,
not June. What a shame! Anyway, I've corrected my diary entries and
got things straight (I think). I guess that the problem was that
both months start with a "J".</p>

<p>Now, to the next (and final?) chapter on the mac: I returned it to
my uncle and set up the other mac on his store just to see if I
could get Debian installed. Well, I kind of could: I got the
bootfloppies installed in 1GB HD and was very surprised to see an
almost entire setup with the network. Amazing. I'm almost without
words: just grab 4 FDs and install a whole operating system in your
machine with them. <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> definitely keeps
its lead over other distributions this way.</p>

<p>Well, enough ads. I could get almost everything installed, but the
HD died (for good?) soon after the packages were being extracted
onto the new filesystem. I tried the other (4GB) HD, but it wasn't
being seen by <code>mac-fdisk</code> for an unknown reason (despite it being
recognized during the SCSI bus scan and the partition check).</p>

<p>Well, I guess that I can consider this as my first installation of
Linux on a PowerPC architecture, which could not be concluded only
because the hardware didn't help, but both the operator (that's me!
) and the software were right.</p>

<p>Watched "Monty Python's Life of Brian" after that. Sent both my VCR
and TV set to the technician. For some strange reason, both
<a href="http://www.konqueror.org">Konqueror</a> and
<a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a> are not rendering this page
