<p>So, now I am officially a maintainer of the
<a href="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/algorithms.html">algorithms</a>
package, which makes me quite happy. Many thanks go to the previous
maintainer, Peter Williams, for creating such a great piece of
software.</p>

<p>Also, it seems that finally <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a> has
understood that the scientific community uses Unix and they have
released
<a href="ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/unix/7x/7.0/enu/">Acrobat/Adobe Reader 7.0</a>
for Linux, with widgets with <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">Gtk 2.0</a>. TrÃ¨s
cool.</p>

<p>BTW, I have stopped reading on Graph Theory just for a tiny bit to
learn things on Abstract Algebra. I want to study algebraic
properties of graphs and, for that, I have to get my rusty algebra
in shape. Also, some Linear Algebra wouldn't hurt.</p>

<p>Had the pleasant experience of watching "Constantine". The
comparisons with "The Exorcist" are obvious here, even though this
one is a nice movie. BTW, it seems that after the Matrix series,
Keanu Reeves is doomed to Sci-Fi movies with lots of special
effects. It's not a bad thing, nor a good thing. Just an
observation.</p>

<p><em>Trivia:</em> It was a pleasant surprise to see (humm, hear actually)
that David Brubeck's Quarted "Take Five" was on the soundtrack. Oh,
and they insist on putting a
<a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">PowerBook</a> on the movie. That is
simply tempting. This is not the first movie that I see where
something made by <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> appears on the big
screen.</p>

<p>Of course, going to the supermarket after the movie was also quite
nice, if you know what I mean. And the pleasant company was also
highly appreciated. It couldn't be much better that this (really).</p>

<p>Happy Easter for those who celebrate it! And it's all about
chocolate eggs. I love that (even though I have been limiting my
consumption of chocolate to a manageable minimum).</p>

<p>And I should say (once more) that I hate preparing tests. But one
thing that I hate more than preparing tests is scoring them,
especially when students make some confusing solutions that
<em>partially</em> solve the problem, but takes you almost an hour to
notice that! And that's just for one question...</p>

<p>Downloading huge quantities of new material, thanks to
<a href="http://www.easytree.org/">easytree.org's torrents</a>. Many
<a href="http://www.opeth.com/">Opeth</a> and
<a href="http://www.porcupinetree.com/">Porcupine Tree</a> bootlegs, including
videos. Oh, and some old-school Metallica. I'm also seeding many
torrents (right now, five).</p>

<p>Well, since <a href="http://news.individual.net/">news.individual.net</a> is
going to be paid starting from April 1st, I was checking if my
damned <a href="http://www.uol.com.br/">ISP</a> provides news. That's not
because I don't want to pay news.individual.net, but rather because
I felt that I shouldn't be using an external news server, since I
am already paying for Internet access and, IMNSHO, Usenet is one of
the basic services that every provider has to provide.</p>

<p>Well, I am sincerely considering going to sign up with
<a href="http://www.terra.com.br/">their competitor</a>, which has a huge
amount of groups in their service, including those that I want to
read (i.e., <a href="news:comp.theory">comp.theory</a>,
<a href="news:comp.text.tex">comp.text.tex</a>, <a href="news:comp.emacs">comp.emacs</a>,
and <a href="news:sci.math">sci.math</a>).</p>

<p>Woohoo! Finally I received a nice little package with two G3
upgrade cards (and one IMSTT card). This is great news for me to
upgrade the PowerMac 9500/180MP that I have here.</p>

<p>Curiously, only one of its memory sticks (it has 2 32MB sticks) was
being recognized by the system. I had to open it and it took me
quite some time to figure out why (after some tweaking) the system
wouldn't boot anymore. I have no idea why, but just zapping the
NVRAM worked (i.e., Cmd+Option+P+R).</p>

<p>The next step now is to see if I can get more memory for this
system, so that I can actually use it after this welcome upgrade.
Then, I will surely be playing with
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>'s
<a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/sarge">sarge</a>.</p>
