<p>Oh, the surgery day. Unforgettable. The pain. The Pain. The PAIN.
The <strong>PAIN</strong>. And the lack of care by some of the hospital
personnel. If it were not for my parent's support, I would surely
have signed any authorization for euthanasia and not be here right
now.</p>

<p>Mom's birthday. And a nice opportunity to see some relatives here.
Quite nice to have all them together. And it wasn't free of
surprising things. Something that once would be attached to geeks
was actually the subject of conversations for a moment: the use of
Internet.</p>

<p>In some sense, I feel that being the pioneer of the family to have
used Internet was interesting. But, then, motivated by the recent
surgery that I "survived", made me see things in a quite different
fashion: using the Internet and computers like there's no tomorrow
is a pure waste of time.</p>

<p>I think that the Internet is slowly turning into the new TV. There
are obvious differences, because you are in command of (some)
things, but, to be honest, I am not exactly sure that people are
that much in control as they think that they are.</p>

<p>In other news, I have started playing with Java's multithreaded
abilities. A nice way to play with them, but the book that I have
here requires a lot of patience on my part: it is a translation of
"The Java Programming Language", 1st edition. The catch is that the
stupid person that tranlated it also translated <em>commands</em> of the
language and names of classes! Is this a contest of foolness or
what?</p>

<p>I went to the physician today again to see how far I progressed. It
seems that I am going well all, within the expected, and that I
will be back in shape in two months. Nice to know that.</p>

<p>Also had the opportunity to listen to the newest
<a href="http://www.opeth.com/">Opeth</a> album, <em>Ghost Reveries</em> quite a bit
earlier than its official release date (30th of August), according
to
<a href="http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=39014">Blabbermouth</a>.
Sweet!</p>

<p>In a burst of nostalgia, I decided to see what the
<a href="http://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> had to say about my
first web presence. Unfortunately, due to the fact that my account
was mistakenly deleted by our former system administrator and then
recovered again, it didn't show me my first page.</p>

<p>But, on the bright side of things, I actually found pages of
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970803122922/www.ime.usp.br/~lymber/">two</a>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010428082758/www.ime.usp.br/~malmeida/">friends</a>
dating back from when homepages weren't that common: at about
1995/1996. Almost a decade ago!</p>

<p>And, in the very same fashion, I tried to find my first usenet
posts, that are stored now at
<a href="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</a>. The earliest post that
I could find was dated
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/byx6a">21st of December of 1994</a> (now more than
a decade ago), but I am sure that there were posts of mine that
preceded that.</p>

<p>Made some commits to the CVS version of
<a href="http://sf.net/projects/lame">lame</a>, since version 3.97 is expected
to have its status upgraded from alpha to beta.</p>

<p>Took care of spell-fixing some bits of documentation, but didn't
have the time to do a proper job. Some work will be postponed until
the 3.98 release opens for development.</p>

<p>Oh, and it seems that <a href="http://algorithms.berlios.de/">algorithms</a>
has reached a good "mind share" in the sense that some leading
Computer Scientists seem to use it.</p>

<p>Just finished reading neat and combinatorial proofs of "Fermat's
Little Theorem" and "Wilson's Theorem" (although only in one
direction) in George E. Andrews's "Number Theory" book from
<a href="http://www.doverpublications.com">Dover</a>.</p>

<p>While this seems to be an elementary book on Number Theory (it
covers just the basics---which I have been trying to learn for some
time now) it is also <em>quite</em> well-written. Perhaps some writers of
computer books could learn a thing or two with Mathematicians.</p>

<p>Had a nice Friday after I woke up. The plan of going to
"Villa-Lobos Shopping Center" just to see a movie ended up being
better by <em>not</em> seeing the movie. It was just as pleasant as it
could get.</p>

<p>Going back home wasn't that easy, though, but I eventually arrived
at my place without further problems.</p>

into a DVD. This is so easy to do with
