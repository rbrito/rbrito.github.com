<p>Today I bought some books at Pearson Education. They were not that
cheap, but I think that some of their content is worth the amount
spent. During the time I was there, BTW, I met 8 colleagues (at
least, that I could count). So much for coincidence. <img src="../../../smileys/smile.png" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>After that, I went to Santa IfigÃªnia to get myself an used Duron
1.3GHz processor (actually, I went there to get conductive ink so
that I could overclock my Duron 600MHz processor). Unfortunately, I
can't make it work with anything higher than 1.1GHz on my
motherboard (an old classic Asus A7V). Bummer.</p>

<p>Spent the whole day trying to make my system work as it always did.
I now suspect that I need some RAM, but I am not forking the cash
for PC133 modules right now (my budget is now tight).</p>

<p>Holy freaking day! Today we had
<a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html">the announcement</a>
that <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> will be switching to
<a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel processors</a>. This is a major movement,
in my very humber opinion. Does this mean that all the claims about
PowerPC being more effective are not true anymore (well, that may
be the case with Power 970 processors, but G3 processors seem to be
quite nice regarding power comsumption).</p>

<p>As if that weren't enough news for one day,
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> finally, after almost 3 (<em>three</em>)
years,
<a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2005/20050606">released a new version of its distribution</a>,
codenamed sarge. This is the major news for the day (and for the
month, if you ask me).</p>

<p>And like if that weren't enough, Linus Torvalds also
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.12-rc6.bz2">announced kernel 2.6.12-rc6</a>,
which is (hopefully) one of the final stages towards kernel 2.6.12
proper.</p>

<p>This moment of the year is just hectic. Having to prepare the
finals is a bad moment, but scoring them is really terrible.</p>

<p>Oh, and just as a reminder to myself, to use the subversion tree on
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/">BerliOS</a> for
<a href="http://algorithms.berlios.de">my project/algorithms</a>, I have to
use:
export SVN_SSH="ssh -l myusername"
svn co svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/algorithms/ I keep
forgetting that.</p>

<p>Oh, and I am almost complete with the syllabus of the Linux course.
There is so much that I want to cover that the course will have to
be broken in modules. Four or five modules, that is.</p>

<p>Feelling extremely bad today. I have an enormous headache. I think
that I will work a little bit on
<a href="http://algorithms.berlios.de/">algorithms</a>, but I don't know if I
will be able to commit anything today. I can't really concentrate
and I don't want to release something that I am not proud of.</p>

<p>I have, BTW, been swamped by e-mail. Please, stop the madness! I
can understand why Donald Knuth quit this 15 years ago. I
understand that he must be a happier man without Internet annoying
him (especially since he is such a precious celebrity).</p>

<p>The funnier thing is that people rarely realize how they are doing
things backwards today: they are working more for the computer than
the computer is working for them. They don't care about things
being automated, which is one thing where computers shine at.</p>

<p>In fact, I think that such things are the way they are due to the
ignorance of the potential of a computer. Indeed, there are tasks
that a computer can't embrace (the halting problem, the tiling
problem etc already told us this), but for other mundane things,
computers are useful. Just not the way people seem to be using
them.</p>

<p>And this, BTW, includes people with high education (like many
Ph.D.'s that I know): they simply don't make their life easier. One
example of this in action: using
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> is a way of producing
high-quality documents. But some people that are actually convinced
that LaTeX is the way to go rarely take the time to use this tool
in all its usefulness. What a pity!</p>

<p>Whenever I see people doing wrong things, I tell them a better way.
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~lymber/">Very few</a> seem to understand that,
but others don't.</p>

<p>In other news, Linus released a new
<a href="http://www.kernel.org">kernel</a>, 2.6.12.</p>

<p>Ugh! Just having the thought of having to teach Object-Oriented
Databases gives me headaches---I haven't dealt with Databases for
quite some time and seeing yet another paradigm would just be
insane.</p>

<p>Oh, I finally got the chance to (successfully) use
<a href="http://fuse.sf.net">FUSE</a> and
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Andrew Morton's Linux Tree</a> so that I
could finally use
<a href="http://richard.jones.name/google-hacks/gmail-filesystem/gmail-filesystem.html">gmailfs</a>
with my <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>
<a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/">testing</a> system.</p>

<p>It makes a real mess on your account. So, I would advise you o
create a dummy account if you intend to use it "seriously" (and
don't forget to encrypt what you think is sensitive information).
But it is a damn nice hack.</p>

<p>I have discovered that while Linus' 2.6.12 kernel seems OK with my
IDE HD in the Firewire enclosure, both of Andrew Morton's <code>-mm1</code> and
<code>-mm2</code> trees are broken regarding the device. I posted to the lkml
and got some nice responses. That's one of the reasons why Open
Source Software is good: you can actually get in touch with people
responsible for fixing things without "the middle man".</p>

<p>Have been chaotically reading about <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a>,
since I am excited by all the progress that the
<a href="http://www.kaffe.org/">Free</a> <a href="http://www.sablevm.org/">Software</a>
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/java/">Implementations</a>
<a href="http://jikes.sf.net/">of</a> Java have shown recently. It seems that
the major milestone now is to improve the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">Classpath</a> project. Every
other JVM would benefit from a bigger implementation of the Java
API from GNU Classpath, if I understand things correctly.</p>

<p>When I said that I was chaotically reading about Java, I meant the
first edition of James Gosling's book (that's the only one that I
have here). Unfortunately, the translation that I have is <em>so</em> full
of <strong>atrocious</strong> errors that it is a disservice to an otherwise
fine book (even if somewhat outdated).</p>

<p>Oh, and by chaotically reading things, I also meant reading about
how <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> 1.1 works, so that
I can better manage <a href="http://algorithms.berlios.de/">algorithms</a>.</p>
