<p>Went to the physician to see if I needed new glasses. Even her was
surprised when she saw the results of the tests: I will have to be
subject to more tests as what she saw wan't sufficient for a
decision: my right eye's retina may have some danification. I don't
know if I am happy about this result or not, but it finally seems
to be on track of being diagnosed.</p>

<p>I have now, with the help of an oooold
<a href="http://www.atitech.ca/">ATI Mach 64 GX</a> card (with only 2MB of
VRAM) gotten <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">MacOS X 10.3.9</a> to work
on the
<a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powermac/stats/powermac_9500_180mp.html">PowerMac</a>.
I then substituted the card with an IMS Twin Turbo card that has
4MB of VRAM. It seems to work well, considering that this machine
has almost 10 years (a PeeCee normally doesn't last this much). If
I were to upgrade this machine, I would start by the following two
items (perhaps not in this order):</p>

<ol>
<li>Substitude its HD.</li>
<li>Add more RAM to it. MacOS X likes a lot of RAM.</li>
</ol>


<p>Perhaps I may get a <a href="http://www.sonnettech.com/">Sonnet Tech</a>
<a href="http://www.sonnettech.com/product/tempo_trio.html">Tempo Trio</a>
card, which features an IDE controller, a Firewire controller and a
USB 2.0 controller in just one card. Seems like a good deal,
especially for using (faster, modern) IDE HDs, all this being able
to just use a single slot of the machine.</p>

<p>Today it was a "software writing" day. I woke up early in the
morning and then I decided to fix
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/src:vrms">vrms</a>. I have almost taken the
role of a maintainer, with the exception that I am not one. I have
changed the severity of bugs, merged them etc. All without the
maintainers saying <strong>anything</strong>. Impressive.</p>

<p>I, then, updated the package and put a new version of it at
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~rbrito/debian/">my homepage</a> for perusal by
other developers.</p>

<p>In other news, I have updated the page for the
<a href="http://algorithms.berlios.de">algorithms</a> package, now with a
<a href="http://algorithms.berlios.de/screenshots.html">screenshot</a>. I have
also done some janitorial work on the
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?group_id=3442">feature requests</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00020.html">sarge won't be released on the 30th of May</a>,
unfortunately.</p>

<p>I think that I have fallen in love with
<a href="http://www.afterforever.com/new/pages/photos/pinkpop04/original/16.JPG">Floor</a>
<a href="http://www.afterforever.com/new/pages/photos/pinkpop04/original/11.JPG">Jansen</a>.
Or would that be
<a href="http://www.within-temptation.com.br/info/integrantes/sharon.htm">Sharon den Adel</a>?
Or would that be Anneke van Giersbergen? Or would that be Liv
Kristine? Or <a href="http://www.tarjaturunen.com/">Tarja Turunen</a>? I
sincerely don't know.</p>

<p>In other news, the floppy drive of my Desktop has decided to be
deceased, unfortunately. I "fixed" the problem by cannibalizing my
old 486 and getting its floopy drive to serve as a substitute.
Worked like a charm! It is a pain to have to open both machines and
to get the hands dirty, but at least, it seems that I am not a
Computer Scientist that doesn't even know how to fix his own
boxes.</p>

<p>Oh, I wrote a little bit more regarding the Linux course that I
will teach at my local University. The program is getting huge and
I will probably be covering things that are not very well
documented (yes, I'll have to study such topics), but it will be
rewarding for the students (and among such "students" of mine I
will have many co-workers!).</p>

<p>My plan is to make such a course be sufficient for certification
purposes of those that will be taking it. Of course, with a twist
and a high dose of Unix philosophy (which is good anyway, for
everybody).</p>

<p>Oh, and Debian never ceases to amaze me! I have just discovered a
very handy packaged called
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/freepops">freepops</a> that lets me
download my mail from my old account at
<a href="http://www.mail.com/">mail.com</a> via pop3. Quite nice to be able to
use that address again. And also as a bonus, it also acts as a
front-end for <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com/">mail.yahoo.com</a>, which means
that I am again able to read my mail there (again via pop3). So
nice that I can't even describe how happy I am.</p>
