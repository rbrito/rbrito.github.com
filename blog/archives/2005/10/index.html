<p>Ok, so, I am almost giving up the hectic mess in which work has
turned to... I need to take a serious time resting a little bit.</p>

<p>I'm so tired and people are so demanding of me and of my creativity
that its hard to even take some time with pleasant things. For
instance, in the little time that I have to sleep, I don't have the
motivation to study the neat things that I always wanted to.</p>

<p>I guess that this means that I'm overworked, without any shadow of
doubt. Being sleepy while at work has never been a common thing for
me, even when I was in the tiring days of my M.Sc. studies.</p>

<p>In fact, in those days, I thought that I was progressing (and it's
hard not to feel you're progressing when you're being pushed to
your limits), but now, with little time for intellectual
challenges, I see little point in keeping up with the work I'm
doing.</p>

<p>It's not particularly exciting to be teaching how to write a for
for the 20th time in less than two years. I guess that if the
concept of iteration doesn't enter one's brain as soon as it is
told, then all is hopeless.</p>

<p>I guess that I need a significant other to make everything bright
(even those less-than-perfect moments). Someone that truly
understands what I mean, what my ideals are, what my values are and
how I see the world.</p>

<p>And, yes, I am willing to even change some things of me. But please
don't disillusion me. In some sense, I'm fragile. Even more than
most people think that I am. Despite the tough cover that I may
have, lies a friendly person. Truly.</p>

<p>In other news, <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> has released a bunch
of new stuff, with the highlight (for me, at least), being the new
<a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">PowerBook</a>s.</p>

<p>Today was voting day and that sucks.</p>

<p>My "dreams" of using DocBook/XML to generate my documentation
ceased to be when I read that passivetex is barely maintained. And,
actually, trying to use <a href="http://packages.debian.org/xmlto">xmlto</a>
with a very simple document seems to generate good XHTML, but
doesn't even work when one tries to generate DVI or PS or PDF
output.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should try to use
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/docbook-utils">docbook-utils</a> instead.</p>
