<p>Holy moly! Things now seem to be going! I'm quite happy with all
this.</p>

<p>First of all, I clearead all the bugs in
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/hfsprogs"><code>hfsprogs</code></a>, including a
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/436159">very long standing bug</a> in Apple's code
that prevented me from compiling everything in 64-bits.</p>

<p>Now, the package compiles under all arches, which is amazingly
great. I also took the opportunity to
<a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/Darwin-userlevel/2009/Nov/msg00004.html">tell Apple</a>that
I have patches that I want to push upstream. Let's see if they are
indeed open to collaboration.</p>

<p>I'm learning to use the marvellous
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/quilt"><code>quilt</code></a> to clean up some code of
others. With a bit of discipline, things get quite easy to work with. A
good tool can, indeed, make one's job much easier.</p>

<p>Oh, an TeXlive 2009 was <em>just</em> uploaded to experimental, which
means that it will soon reach unstable. I am already using it and
it is quite nice (actually, I've been using it for a bit longer
than this, but the fact is that it is now available everywhere).
Thanks Norbert, Frank, Hilmar and Co.</p>

<p>On some other news, I am now maintaining "my" version of two nice
packages:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok 1.4</a>, which, although abandoned
upstream, is much more useful (and lighter on resources) than
Amarok 2. I have updated it with some patches and things are much
nicer.</li>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/grip">grip</a>, a very nice CD ripper,
which seems to be dead upstream, but which has some good patches
that are extremely easy to integrate. Coincidentally,
<a href="http://www.debian-multimedia.org/">Christian Marillat</a> has, one
day after I started working on grip, packaged a version to put in
his repository. I think that we could join some forces maintaining
it.</li>
</ul>


<p>Oh, and the biggest news of all: writing manpages is easier than
ever. I always edited Perl's pod files as a way to avoid writing
<code>*roff</code> code directly and using the pod source to generate the
manpages. But I used Emacs's Perl mode. This way, Emacs shows the
pod source as a comment, without recognizing the structure of the
files. That's not a problem anymore. Russ Allbery just hinted me at
the fact that Emacs offers a pod-mode. Amazing.</p>
