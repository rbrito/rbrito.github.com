<p>These past days I have been
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?maint=rbrito@ime.usp.br">crushing some bugs</a>
in <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>'s
<a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/sid">sid</a>.</p>

<p>Two things motivated me to get my acts together:</p>

<ul>
<li>the recent decision to adopt
<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases">time-based freezes</a> in
Debian;</li>
<li>the upcoming release of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>'s
<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases">Karmic Koala</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As can be seen from the list, there is quite a sizeable amount of
work to be done---this is what one gets for adopting otherwise
orphaned packages or packages that have moderately sized audiences.
But, on the other hand, it is also pleasant to get the software
moving (approximately) in the direction that I want.</p>

<p>I say approximately because the packages on which my packages
depend may have some un-wanted dependencies, which, in turn, will
still pull in some nasty amount of things that don't belong in a
system tuned to have small footprint (especially important for
netbooks, low-powered desktops, and embedded systems).</p>

<p>Oh, BTW, please note that time-based <em>releases</em> are not the same
thing as time-based <em>freezes</em>, even though what I provided is a
link for the time-based releases. The concepts are close, though.</p>

<p>There's something that needs to be documented somewhere, since it
is not obvious when skimming the documentation and when one is
using
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/git-buildpackage"><code>git-buildpackage</code></a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> How does one specify a key to git-buildpackage that
doesn't match the ones that it <em>thinks</em> that you should use?
<strong>A:</strong> Just specify that you want it to use a "builder" different
that the default one, like the option
<code>--git-builder="debuild -i\.git -I.git -krbrito"</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> How does one tells that the source should always be
included (say, like one of your collaborators already tagged a git
repository with the debian revision and you need to make a change
to upload it and commit another tag to the repository or, e.g.,
when a security upload should be made to security.debian.org)?
<strong>A:</strong> The answer is almost the same. Use the option
<code>--git-builder="debuild -i\.git -I.git -sa"</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Went to the Brazilian national Security Service, to see the status
of my sick leave.</p>

<p>After that, I took some time and went to see
<a href="http://tiagovaz.org/">Tiago Vaz</a>, who attended
<a href="http://debconf9.debconf.org/">this year's</a>
<a href="http://www.debconf.org/">DebConf</a>, which I couldn't attend. I also
met his friendly partner. Well, both are so kind and I felt at home
at his place.</p>

<p>I took some small moments to perform a mini, private key-signing
party, so that we both strengthen our trust networks.</p>

<p>And last, but not least, I got the package that Martin kindly sent
me via Tiago and I'll now start to play with it. I have never
played with an arm-based platform before. Let's see if it is not an
alien to myself.</p>

<p>I'm closing some bugs in many packages in Debian, including my
preferred backup system,
<a href="http://www.mondorescue.org/">Mondo Rescue</a>. The good thing about
it is that it generates a backup that is a "mirror" (or should I
say "snapshot"?) of your system and puts it on a CD (or DVD, or ISO
image, or many other formats, actually).</p>

<p>I make backups almost every single day and I try to keep them
small. Very small. The purpose is to have everything fit on a
single 650MB CD, the reason being twofold:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are more computers with a CD drive than with a DVD drive
(or a Bluray drive, for that matter). To be honest, I have never
ever seen a bluray drive.</li>
<li>It is easier to find 650MB CDs than 700MBs (well, that's
changing fast). Also, making it smaller than a certain amount
leaves room for Error Correcting Codes, like those created by the
superb <a href="http://dvdisaster.net/en/">dvdisaster</a>. With some
overburning, I can even squeeze one or two megabytes more in the
CD.</li>
