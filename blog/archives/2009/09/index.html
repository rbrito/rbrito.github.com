<p>Today I'm turning up one year more. The good side of that it is a
"psychological barrier" to evaluate what I've done this past year.
Well, it was actually mildly positive. Contributed to many
(diverse) programs, reported a handful of bugs and, generally, made
things go better the way I like it.</p>

<p>I have also spent some time to evangelize people that has, in turn,
evangelized some other people regarding Free Software. This is
good.</p>

<p>In summary, the whole year had its up and downs, but I think that
it had more ups than downs.</p>

<p>Much to my please, I received today some nice people for my
birthday. <a href="http://blog.safira.com/">Adriano</a>'s presence was nice
(and I even had the opportunity to play with his last generation
iBook G4, and fix his keyboard), my Grandma, Jacob, Mom, Dad, Rose,
and Sa made a nice birthday party.</p>

<p>And, of course, being with Adriano is always illuminating: I
learned about a book, about
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089457/">a movie</a>, about some MacOS X
programs that he runs, about some other concepts, about an
<a href="http://www.worldofgoo.com/">independent game</a> that he supported
for MacOS X and so on. Always a pleasure to talk with him.</p>

<p>Since I maintain a Darwin partition on my system, I use
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-legacy.en.html">GRUB legacy</a>
to choose which OS I want to play with. But, then, due some of my
tweaking, it stopped working. Ouch. Even if I selected it, it
wouldn't boot and would return to GRUB's menu. Irritating, to say
the least.</p>

<p>Being disappointed with that, I eventually,
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/">RTFM of GRUB</a>
and learned a bit more about something that seems to give
<a href="http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=107391">hackintosh</a>
users some headaches: the partition bootloader being foobared.</p>

<p>The solutions presented there are bizantine from a Unix P-o-V. The
necessary steps to fix it are just to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure that the <strong>hard disk</strong> bootloader (that is, the MBR
of your HD) contains GRUB's <code>stage 1</code> loader.
<em>Warning:</em> don't just <code>dd</code> it to your HD's file, so that your
system can "forget" the partitions that you have.</li>
<li>Make sure that the <strong>partition</strong> bootloader (something that is
peculiar to the x86 arches and which, I as a user of other
platforms, didn't know that existed) is set to Apple's <code>boot1h</code>.
This time, you can just <code>dd</code> it to the first sector of the
partition where Darwin/MacOS X resides.</li>
<li>Teach GRUB to set its snippet to run Darwin with
<code>root (hd0,0)</code> (or whatever partition contains Darwin), tell it
to make the partition active with <code>makeactive</code>, and tell it to load
the <strong>partition</strong> bootloader with <code>chainloader +1</code>.</li>
<li>(Optional) Edit
<code>/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist</code> to
contain the elements <code>&lt;key&gt;Kernel&lt;/key&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;string&gt;mach_kernel.foo&lt;/string&gt;</code> to point to whatever is your
kernel of choice.</li>
<li>(Optional) If you make changes under Linux, with the <code>hfsplus</code>
module, it is highly recommended that you unmount your filesystem
and run the <code>fsck.hfsplus</code> from the
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/hfsplus">hfsplus</a> package that I
maintain in <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> (and which is mirrored
by <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, but Debian's is more
up-to-date, as I have uploads rights there).</li>
<li>(Optional)
<a href="http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/testing-stuff-with-qemu-part-3-debian-gnu-kfreebsd">Test it with QEMU</a>,
to see if it will work.</li>
</ol>

<p>This was a nice learning exercise, to be honest.</p>
