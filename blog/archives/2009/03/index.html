<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>Inspired by the <code>m3s.pl</code> script made by Scott Lawrence, and given
the fact that he doesn't care anymore about it, I decided to see
what I could do so that I could generate MP3 CDs that will play
well with iTunes (like if they were regular audio CDs, but with
huge capacity and without connecting to the network to fetch
metadata).</p>

<p>It turns out that the script could really gain some improvements
and that having it up to date has forced me to remember some Perl.
I made a lot of successful, incremental improvements by
encapsulating the code and making it reasonably readable (even with
a language that people say that is only "writeable", but not
"readable").</p>

<p>I implemented things inserting data into a hash and then using the
name of the types of the fields that have to be in the
ContentsDB.xml file to write the appropriate values, but then I saw
that what I was doing was quite silly and implemented things in an
easier, cleaner way. Taking care to have things encoded in utf-8
and escaping the &amp; character when writing the XML file.</p>

<p>The original program used the <code>MP3::Info</code> module to gather
information about the songs. This module isn't as rich as the
<code>MP3::Tag</code> module (which is able to get track numbers, track
counts, disc numbers, and disc counts, just off the top of my
head). This "new" module is quite good and more flexible and that's
what I adopted.</p>

<p>Also, to traverse the directory tree, I am using <code>File::Find</code>,
instead of a home-brew solution to the problem. There is only one
thing left for the script to be finished: having it write correctly
the "numerical path", as <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> likes to
call it.</p>

<p>Well, remembering things about references, compound data
structures, object orientation, the use of modules etc. has made me
gain some interest in Perl again. I think that I will make some
effort and learn it again.</p>

<p>Oh, and I just submitted my third patch for the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux kernel</a>: it fixes the compilation
(and recognition) of the MTD device of the Kurobox HD that I have.
Now, I am running a brand new 2.6.29-rc6 kernel (yes, yes, it is
brand new right now, but at the breakneck pace with which the
kernel is moving, it will soon be quite outdated; I will try to
keep the powerpc part of things in shape, though).</p>

<p>And last, but not least, was the fact that I was submitted to a
biopsy (the original idea was for it to be just a colonoscopy, but
I had some inflammatory process in my elbows and some material had
to be removed for analysis).</p>

<p>I don't really think that I am finished with all these health
things, but I surely made some improvements.</p>

<p>Oh, I lied when I said that the biopsy thing was the last one that
I would write about. I am in the process of compressing movies with
the help of the <a href="http://divxenc.sourceforge.net/"><code>divxenc</code></a>,
<a href="http://xvidenc.sourceforge.net/"><code>xvidenc</code></a> and
<a href="http://h264enc.sourceforge.net/"><code>h264enc</code></a> scripts to generate
videos that are appropriate for playing in some set top boxes
<strong>and</strong> getting smaller files (which means that I will make my
small NAS last a little bit longer).</p>

<p>And since I discovered how to register myself on the iTunes music
store, I am downloading some German Podcasts. Will I be able to
learn some German? Well, I dearly hope so. My only grief is that I
am desperately running out of space and I will have to rethink my
backup strategy to leave some room for things to come.</p>

<p>And I also played a little with MacOS X Tiger on Intel and the fact
that my e100 card didn't work with Tiger out-of-the box. I had to
use a special kernel extension for this very purpose. The only
thing that annoys me a lot is that I can trigger kernel panics with
the JaS kernel 10.4.8 in a deterministic manner. Upgrading the
kernel to 10.4.10 made my system not mount some disk images (and
even "real" disks, like my iPod video). I should, perhaps, try
Leopard here to see how things are structured and to see the
changes that Apple has provided to the system.</p>

<p>Regarding some cutting-edge programs, I saw that some programs were
removed from Debian after the release of lenny, since upstream is
inactive or dead. Too bad. But the nice side of things is that
snapshot.debian.net is a terrific service to the community and I've
compiled things from there and got excellent results. I think that
I may even create a non-official repository with some multimedia
programs (and this includes, say, a newer, multithreaded version of
mplayer and newer libraries). I think that I will submit some more
bugreports (like the Real Video files from Ars Technica that can't
be played).</p>

<p>And one last thing: (this one is really the last thing that I will
comment now) is that I finally will re-record my audio (and video)
things on digital media, so that I can preserve it without the loss
of magnetic media. This is a time-consuming activity, but I think
that it is worth the effort, especially if I use an automated setup
like Audacity's noise removal tool. Or is it better to use sox for
this task? I guess that I will have to experiment a little.</p>

<p>Surfing on Orkut (yes, I still use it sometimes), I found a torrent

<p>My girlfriend had some complications in her biopsy and I had to
play the nurse role. Deinfecting the place and going with her to
the medical service was the next step. Actually, she went to a
vascular physician and to a general physician.</p>

<p>After she was medicated, we went to the bank and I was there to
learn some things about the private social security system of
Brazil, with two plans: VGBL and PGBL. They seem like a reasonable
thing to use, but I fear that I will need the money in less time
than what was told me that I have to keep it there for not having
to pay a huge amount of taxes.</p>

<p>Oh, talking about taxes, I installed the Brazilian tax program,
written in Java, since I don't have Windows. Surprisingly, it
doesn't play well with openjdk-6-jre, which is quite amusing.
Falling back to the non-free jre 5.0 did the job, but this makes me
think that SERPRO (I think that this is the department responsible
for writing the programs) didn't really grasp the meaning of
"portability": they are only delivering binaries for Linux x86. No
amd64, powerpc and other architectures. What a shame.</p>

<p>Slept a good amount (but not sufficient) and then I went to
recreate my debian-local repository. I ended up reshaping two
packages: checkpasswd and serialmail. I didn't do a very good job,
but, then, I'm only making those things for my own consumption
(which means that I'm not really keeping up to date with all the
lintian warnings).</p>

<p>I am also converting some more videos from MPEG-1 format to MPEG-4
ASP (DX50) mode. This time, I started with
<a href="http://www.megadeth.com/">Megadeth</a>'s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock_1999">Woodstock'99</a>
concert. It had considerable image noise, and, to reduce the
bitrate, I had to use quite a strong noise filtering with
<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">mencoder</a>'s <code>hqdn3d</code>.</p>

<p>Found out about "The Right Way (TM)" to hash an existing SSH's
<code>known_hosts</code> file (<code>ssh-keygen -H</code>) and how to remove a hashed host
entry from your <code>known_hosts</code> file: <code>ssh-keygen -H -R host.name</code>. I
needed this for newer checkouts of LAME's CVS repository at
<a href="http://sf.net/">Sourceforge</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, BTW, just to save myself the trouble of looking it up again,
here is the link to the place where sourceforge keeps their
<a href="http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/sitedocs/wiki/SSH%20%20%20%20%20key%20fingerprints">SSH key fingerprints</a>.
I'm always lost trying to find it, so I thought that it would be
best to record it here.</p>

<p>Also discovered a <em>really</em> amazing thing: a
<a href="http://librivox.org/">free source of audiobooks</a> in podcast
format, while I was looking for René Descartes' "The Method". While
surfing the net, I also found that there is this
<a href="http://www.dominiopublico.gov.br/pesquisa/DetalheObraForm.do?select_action=&amp;co_obra=2274">very same text</a>
in a <a href="http://www.dominiopublico.gov.br/">Brazilian site</a> backed by
the government that hosts works in the public domain.</p>

<p>Still downloading Pain of Salvations Acoustic set. Now, I finally
had some time to watch the somewhat incomplete VOBs and it, indeed,
has the show. And it is an amazing piece of music. Recommended for
all fans of good music.</p>

<p>The acoustic show of Pain of Salvation is really nice. I didn't
have enough time to watch it yet, but it is an amazing thing that
should be kept, as the performance is superb (I did look quickly at
some points of it and, of course, the expectations have been
met---we are, after all, talking about a band that has a unique
touch).</p>

<p>Oh, speaking about unique bands, I will be seeing Opeth playing
live here in Brazil. Yes. This day has arrived. I will see my
favourite band playing here. I guess that I have to get in touch
with Mikael and see if I can sneak in a camera, so that I can shot
and film the show. This will be amazing, to say the least.</p>

<p>Have been playing with the great idea of
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2009/03/msg00210.html">caching</a>
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/318658/">deb</a> packages. I finally settled
for the option of using
<code>&lt;a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-ocaml-maint/packages/approx.git"&gt;approx&lt;/a&gt;</code>,
which does a really nice job of caching packages.</p>

<p>Actually, it fullfils quite a lot of requirements and even
surpasses some of my expectations:</p>

<ul>
<li>It supports multiple architectures (in fact, this is important
for me, as I use <code>i386</code>, <code>amd64</code>, and <code>powerpc</code>.</li>
<li>It can support multiple distributions (both different versions
of the same distribution and completely different distributions, as
long as they use a repository like
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>'s, as is the case of
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>).</li>
<li>It keeps its directory hierarchy neatly organized, like that of
Debian, in a package pool, which saves space and makes everything
easier and faster to find (and has the advantage of being fast with
filesystems that don't cope well with many entries in one
directory).</li>
</ul>


<p>The transition wasn't painless from
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/apt-move"><code>apt-move</code></a>, since apt-move
moves the files, but renames them in a way that they don't keep
epochs in their names, which makes <code>approx-import</code> moan about the
packages.</p>

<p>For places where I am too lazy to import the packages, I just
filled the cache redownloading the packages with something
approximately like this:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get -d --reinstall install $(dpkg -l | grep "^ii" | cut -d " " -f 3)
</code></pre>

<p>Well, I hope that this experience happens to be useful for other
people, so that they can benefit from it. Rebuilding packages with
a package cacher is much more pleasant, especially if the package
has a lot of build-dependencies.</p>

<p>Just when I thought that I had enough things to play with, I
discovered some great tools on the 'net.</p>

<p>The first of this (and what consumed me a good amount of time) is
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/pkfix-helper/">pkfix-helper</a>,
an auxiliary script for
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/pkfix/">pkfix</a> that
guesses the fonts used by old PostScript documents generated by
dvips with fonts that are scalable and that are much better to
transform to PDF format than bitmapped fonts. I even got some time
to write about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkfix">pkfix</a> so that
people get a better idea of what it is all about (the previous
version of the document was quite bad).</p>

<p>Another tool that I've been playing with are mind-mappers. One from
KDE (which I can't recall right now) and one implemented in Java,
called <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/">Freemind</a>. Using those
tools is quite fun and you also get a better idea of what you have
to do (say, using them as a task planner). Interesting stuff.</p>

<p>I just don't understand why it is listed in
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>'s contrib section, while it is
Free Software and its dependencies seem to be fulfiled with Free
Software only (remember that Java has, now, Free virtual
Machines).</p>
