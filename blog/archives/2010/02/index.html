<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>I have been keeping my <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> files under version control since I was
introduced to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/">AUCTeX</a> and I realized that a good way to approach the
"evolutionary" approach to software (this includes text) is to use a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">revision control system</a>.</p>

<p>I started using that with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> 21 (the first version of Emacs that I
used was Emacs 19.something which I can't remember) and the revision system
that was most easily available was <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/">RCS</a>. Its integration with Emacs
was very good and also easy to use: type <code>C-x v-v</code> and a check in is
performed (or a check out, depending on the state of the file). You would be
asked for a changelog for that file and that was it.</p>

<p>Now, on the other hand, there is a myriad of options and one that looks very
nice to me (apart from not dealing with metadata, but that's OK with me for
the moment) is Linus Torvald's <a href="http://git-scm.com/"><code>git</code></a>. The very nice thing with <code>git</code>
(or many other such systems) is that the interface with Emacs is exactly the
same: <code>C-x v-v</code>. That's the only thing you need to remember to work well
with, say, your text project. (I don't actually know very much of the
management workflow under Emacs, but I also use the command line a good
amount and it serves me well so far).</p>

<p>But how can I convert my RCS "repositories" to a proper <code>git</code> repository?
Well, git comes with a subcommand called <code>cvsimport</code>, meant to be used with
CVS and this does help, since a CVS repository is essentially just a
collection of RCS files. As many people have migrated along the path from
RCS to CVS to Subversion to git, and I did not intend to convert the
repository in multiple steps, I am documenting what I did here.</p>

<p>So, if you have the <code>,v</code> files that RCS generates (the "repository" files
for each file tracked by RCS) spread in a tree and you would like to convert
that tree to a git repository for replication, backup and "time
machine-like" support, you can mimic a basic CVS repository that can be
converted easily with the following simple steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a new directory hierarchy somewhere, denoted here by
<code>cvs-source-dir</code>. This will play the role of a CVS repository which <code>git
cvsimport</code> will convert.</li>
<li>Under <code>cvs-source-dir</code>, create the directory tree as you would like it to
be visible by <code>git</code>.</li>
<li>As an immediate subdirectory of <code>cvs-source-dir</code>, create a directory named
<code>CVSROOT</code>, that is <code>cvs-source-dir/CVSROOT</code>.</li>
<li>Each immediate subdirectory of <code>cvs-source-dir</code> will play the role of a
CVS module. Just think of that as a project under control of the version
control system.</li>
<li>Think about the <code>,v</code> files as your regular files and put them under the
<code>cvs-source-dir</code> tree, as you would like them to be.</li>
<li>Create the directory where your git repository will reside, denoted here
by <code>git-repo</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>git cvsimport -v -a -A -k -m -d cvs-source-dir -C git-repo cvs-module</code></li>
</ul>

<p>That's it. It seems to perform a very good job of changing a very old system
to something that is modern and with many features (and is distributed).</p>

<p>You may also want to read about the way to convert the ids of commits that
RCS/CVS register to proper (people) names, which git uses. Read the
<code>git-cvsimport</code> manpage for more details on this and other options mentioned
above.</p>
