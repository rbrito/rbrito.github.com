  <a href="../../../posts/simple-annotations-on-compiling-a-linux-kernel-for-an-embedded-platform/">Simple Annotations on Compiling a Linux Kernel for an Embedded Platform</a>


</span>
</div>

<div class="inlinecontent">

<p>Here are some facts distilled from my experience with preparing kernels to
some embedded platforms. In other words, this is some of the stuff that is
usually presumed to be known, but that you won't find compiled in many
places, unfortunately.</p>

<p>I am writing them here in the hope that they can be useful to other folks
trying to compile their kernel to embedded devices (and I would venture to
say that these "non-standard" platforms would become more popular in the
future).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>some machines don't have monitors, keyboards etc. They may only have
network connections (e.g., ethernet) and USB ports. In such cases, it
console" called a netconsole. It can be enabled with the options: is quite
handy to see how the machine is booting with a "virtual console" called a
netconsole. It can be enabled with the options:</p>

<pre><code>CONFIG_NETCONSOLE=y
CONFIG_NETPOLL=y
CONFIG_NET_POLL_CONTROLLER=y
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>You have to tell the kernel where to send the messages that would,
otherwise, be presented on a screen. For sending them over the network, just
tell the kernel to use the command line option:</p>

<pre><code>    netconsole=6666@192.168.11.150/,@192.168.11.149/
</code></pre>

<p>This way, you can easily connect from another (more comfortable?) computer
with something like (this connection is made via UDP, not TCP):</p>

<pre><code>    ip addr add 192.168.11.149/24 broadcast 192.168.11.255 dev eth0
    nc -u -n -p 6666 192.168.11.150 6666
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>while some popular bootloaders for desktops are LILO and GRUB, many other
platforms use other bootloaders: yaboot, quik, bootx, silo, refit, etc. In
the case of embedded platforms, one that is popular is "das uBoot", which
needs a special kind of kernel image, a <code>uImage</code>, instead of a regular
<code>{b}zImage/vmlinu{x,z}</code> image. (Well, actually, some other arches need
images in other formats, like <code>vmlinux.coff</code> etc). Fortunately, the
kernel's makefile knows about some such arches and it generates the
correct image---but it is the task of the packager/distributor to find if
those images are needed or not. For the KuroBox HD/HG, all that is needed
is a simple:</p>

<pre><code>cp &#036;LINUXPATH/arch/powerpc/boot/uImage &#036;BUILT_ROOT/boot/uImage-&#036;VERSION
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>some extra care is needed when generating a kernel for such arches: the
tree of the devices which the kernel needs does not seem to be built
automatically (this is the case of the the KuroBox HD/HG). Something like
this is needed after the compilation of the kernel proper:</p>

<pre><code>./scripts/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb -V 16 -o &#036;BUILT_ROOT/boot/kuroboxHD.dtb-&#036;VERSION ./arch/powerpc/boot/dts/kuroboxHD.dts
./scripts/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb -V 16 -o &#036;BUILT_ROOT/boot/kuroboxHG.dtb-&#036;VERSION ./arch/powerpc/boot/dts/kuroboxHG.dts
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>to cross compile a kernel, don't forget to set the appropriate environment
options, like:</p>

<pre><code>INSTALL_MOD_PATH=&#036;BUILT_ROOT ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu- make clean
INSTALL_MOD_PATH=&#036;BUILT_ROOT ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu- make oldconfig
INSTALL_MOD_PATH=&#036;BUILT_ROOT ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu- make menuconfig
INSTALL_MOD_PATH=&#036;BUILT_ROOT ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu- make all modules
INSTALL_MOD_PATH=&#036;BUILT_ROOT ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu- make modules_install
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>It won't hurt if you use a concurrency setting (like -j3 or more) when
compiling all and modules.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The uBoot command line (accessed via the network) can be something like:</p>

<pre><code>ext2load ide &#036;{hdpart} &#036;{ldaddr} &#036;{hdfile}
ext2load ide &#036;{hdpart} 7f0000 boot/kuroboxHD.dtb
setenv bootargs root=/dev/sda1 netconsole=6666@192.168.11.150/,@192.168.11.149/
bootm &#036;{ldaddr} - 7f0000
</code></pre>

<p>The first two lines tell uBoot to load the both the kernel and the device
tree from the disk to the memory, the third line sets the kernel command
line (familiar to users of the "common" arches) and the fourth line
actually boots the kernel once it is loaded in the memory. Here, ${hdpart}
is the partition where the kernel image ${hdfile} should be loaded from
(usually in the form 0:1, to mean partition 1 from the disk 0), ${ldaddr}
is the memory address where the kernel should be loaded to.</p></li>
<li><p>Something that is handy, no matter what size your machine has: the use of
ext4 (and, in particular, delayed allocation) with ext{2,3}
filesystems. To use it, just put this in your kernel configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>CONFIG_EXT4_USE_FOR_EXT23=y
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Support for daemons like avr-evtd, that need access to a serial port (so
that the user can turn off the device by pressing the power button),
enable:</p>

<pre><code>CONFIG_SERIO=y
CONFIG_SERIO_SERPORT=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250=y
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, you will always have to ssh into the system, become root, and
issue something like:</p>

<pre><code>shutdown -h now
</code></pre>

<p>which is an inconvenience.</p></li>
<li><p>It is very important to set the Real Time Clock options right and this may
not be that obvious for some non-x86 platforms. In particular, for a
KuroBox HD, I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>CONFIG_RTC_CLASS=y
CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS=y
CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE=rtc0
CONFIG_RTC_INTF_SYSFS=y
CONFIG_RTC_INTF_PROC=y
CONFIG_RTC_INTF_DEV=y
CONFIG_RTC_DRV_RS5C372=y
</code></pre>

<p>The last option is, perhaps, the tricky one, and varies from system to
system. Knowing which one to enable is a matter of knowing the specs of
your system and, if not known, discovery by trial-and-error. (For x86
systems, usually <code>CONFIG_RTC_DRV_CMOS=y</code> is sufficient).</p></li>
</ul>

  <a href="../../../posts/changing-some-configuration-from-defaults/">Changing Some Configuration from Defaults</a>


</span>
</div>

<div class="inlinecontent">

<p>Two of my most frequently used tools are, hands down, Emacs and bash. Having a pleasant configuration of one's toolbox is necessary for long-term productivity.</p>

<p>However, newer versions of the programs (any programs) don't always have good, comfortable defaults. That is the case with Emacs 23 and bash 4.</p>

<p>With Emacs 23, by default, the scratch buffer shows some text that, if you want to quickly enter text to be saved, has to be deleted. This can be tolerated for some invocations of the editor. But at some point, it gets on one's nerves.</p>

<p>Luckily, Emacs is so fully customizable that this is not a problem, unless you have to hunt down the right knobs and you are an e-lisp illiterate. That is my case.</p>

<p>After reading an admittedly small amount of documentation, some good lines that ought to be put into one's <code>.emacs</code> file are:</p>

<pre>(setq inhibit-startup-echo-area-message "rbrito")
(setq initial-scratch-message nil); show an empty scratch buffer
(setq inhibit-startup-message t); remove splash screen
</pre>

<p>Another line that may make things more comfortable (especially if you, like me, use Emacs's dired as a filemanager to navigate your folders):</p>

<pre>(defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
</pre>

<p>But configuring Emacs is not always that hard. Seeing a change of behaviour with your shell is scarier. When bash 4 was released, one thing that got implemented is the echo of some characters from the terminal to the screen.</p>

<p>In practice and with my usage pattern, this meant that whenever I was typing a command line, changed my mind and pressed C-c, I got a ^C printed on the screen, usually overwriting one or two characters of what I had typed. And this prevented me from automatically copying and pasting the command that I had typed.</p>

<p>Looking for an answer to that was much harder than to see how to change a parameter on Emacs: every search that I tried on Google with the words "bash" and "Ctrl-C" or some variants of that eventually lead me to "how do I trap a Ctrl-C on my shell script?".</p>

<p>Decided to see what changed, I read the documentation of readline. It didn't help, because I was reading something from version 5. I, then, downloaded the source code and started looking for <code>SIGINT</code>. Then, perusing the code (and the changelog), I saw that with bash 4 and readline 6, a new configuration option was introduced: the <code>echo-control-characters</code> option of readline.</p>

<p>Of course, after knowing this, stopping the undesired behaviour was a simple matter of inserting "<code>set echo-control-characters off</code>" in my <code>.inputrc</code> and think about how much time I spent with that uncomfortable behaviour in some of my preferred tools.</p>

<p>﻿As an addendum to the previous paragraphs (written on February of this year, but only now published), the Debian package of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.23.2">Emacs 23.2</a>, the newest version as of this writing, comes with some configuration that makes it ignore the settings that are used with fontconfig. I did not spend any time trying to see the cause of the problem, but adding a simple</p>

<pre>Emacs*font:            Mono
</pre>

<p>to my <code>.Xdefaults</code> file did the trick and restored back the ability to use DejaVu Sans Mono at the right size on my system.</p>

  <a href="../../../posts/please-let-me-zoom-my-documents-/">Please let me zoom my documents!</a>


</span>
</div>

<div class="inlinecontent">

<p>It all started when I tried to typeset my documents with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia (typeface)">Utopia</a> typeface, which is Free Software, since <a>Adobe liberated it to the TeX Users Group.</a></p>

<p>There are some nice packages for changing fonts in LaTeX with Utopia, like <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/mathdesign-utopia.html"><code>mathdesign</code></a> and <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/fourier.html">fourier</a>. But I wanted to play with a new toy, <a href="http://www.tug.org/xetex/">XeTeX</a>.</p>

<p>Then, seeing as small caps was missing from the fonts that Adobe donated, I tried to just fake them with a program that I had never heard of before: <a href="http://fontforge.sf.net/">fontforge</a>.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/569548">first attempt</a> wasn't that very successful, but, after reading a little bit of the code, <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/569548#15">the reason for the problem was soon discovered</a>.</p>

<p>At the same time, I wanted to <em>see</em> what I had done with a PDF reader. The options aren't many here: xpdf was already removed from Debian's unstable (which is the distribution that I use), trying to <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/527840">update it</a> proved to be unsuccessful and upstream isn't that active (which, by the way, led to the creation of the <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/tree/README">poppler project</a>).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some of the Free PDF viewers seem to be <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/evince/+bug/241604">limited</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=532946">to</a> a <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/evince-list/2007-March/msg00002.html">maximum</a> <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/583119">zoom</a> <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/580495">of 400%</a>, while some documents seem to demand more zooming (especially those with little, tiny letters, and for those people, like myself, that don't have good eyesight).</p>

<p>Patching the programs to eliminate those hardcoded limits isn't that hard, but the results with evince and epdfview can be frightening: <a href="http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/raid6.pdf">a very simple document</a>, when zoomed with epdfview to, say, 1600% uses so much memory that one needs to watch out for the Out Of Memory killer and so much swapping that it is hard to believe. Don't believe my words. Just try it.</p>

<p>But, hey, I just want to see a document without having to suffer too much.  And 400% isn't enough for many documents that I have. Especially when I want to see how a given font has been rendered on a document.</p>

<p>I have not yet investigated the real cause of the huge memory consumption, but I would trust the words of the developers, that <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=303365#c6">evince does everything in a big piece of memory</a>. On the other hand, if one compiles poppler right from the sources, its <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/tree/glib/demo">demo program</a> for the glib backend can display files in a zippy manner, even with very large zooms.</p>

<p>xpdf, though, works very well with higher zoom levels, without making the whole computer grind to a halt. Seeing as Martin Pitt has <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/351279">stripped xpdf to be able to use the poppler backend</a>, I was animated to have the best of both worlds: the frequent updates of poppler and the lightness of xpdf.</p>

<p>Martin's port of xpdf doesn't compile with a recent poppler, though: the library has <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/poppler/2009-May/004665.html">changed</a> <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/12/msg00501.html">a lot</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=551119#c3">since</a> <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-tex-maint/2009/09/msg00203.html">2006</a>.  And, in many respects, for good reason, since the original code is not that clean. But it makes harder for luses like me to use code based on fast-changing libraries.</p>

<p>Well, to cut a long story short, after two afternoons hunting down a  version of poppler that would allow me to compile Martin's xpdf version, I got bored and tried to attack the problem.  Now I can use  this alternative version of xpdf with the poppler backend, with very little dependencies and with little memory usage on my computer. I'm keeping it for my private use, but if anybody else is interested, please let me know.</p>

  <a href="../../../posts/preliminary-support-for-webm-in-youtube-dl/">Preliminary support for webm in youtube-dl</a>


</span>
</div>

<div class="inlinecontent">

<p>I just added some very, very preliminary support for web in <code>youtube-dl</code> which <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes/2010/05/msg02694.html">I uploaded</a> to unstable some minutes ago.</p>

<p>This way, at least people will have some material (in, fact, a chance) to play with this format.  I implemented this because, so far, I was only hoping here that a player for this would emerge. I guess that Debian's ffmpeg/mplayer will take some time, but I was pleased to see that Sebastian Dröge to upload a version of <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes/2010/05/msg02596.html">something</a> that could use the new <code>libvpx</code> codec.</p>

<p>I hope that, now, as a side effect of webm being widely available, more people become interested in <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">Vorbis</a>. More support (no, not "alternative", like <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/">Rockbox</a>, but straight from the manufacturers) for it in hardware devices will be sweet. Well, I can dream. <img src="../../../smileys/smile.png" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>Well, it seems to be time to shape up that local build of mine of the <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/aoyoume/aotuv/">aotuv</a> tuned version of Vorbis with <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/aoyoume/">Aoyumi</a>'s patches for libvorbis.</p>

<p>Exciting times in the multimedia world.</p>

<p>Please, excuse me if you are a connoisseur of fonts and typography. You will
find this boring, but other people may not know.</p>

<p>With that said, something that has been the subject of a joke for
<a href="http://stixfonts.org/proj_timeline.html">many years</a> is the release of a set of fonts designed by a consortium of
pulishers to create a typeface that would "match" the visual of Times, but
that would have many (all?) of the glyphs needed by scientists.</p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://www.stixfonts.org/">the wait is over</a> (surprisingly). I didn't expect that. And the
Free Software part of this is that the fonts were released under the SIL
Open Font Library.</p>

<p>This, together with Google's new <a href="http://code.google.com/webfonts">font directory</a> of Free Software fonts
(overshadowed by the release of VP8 codec, in the eyes of some), shows that
the typographic arena is alive and going strong.</p>
