<p>Watched a tiny bit of the men marathon up to the point were the
African athletes won. This made me sleepy all the day. To make
matters worse, I woke up many times today. Noisy neighbors.</p>

<p>Election day today. It's funny that I thought I'd have problems
standing in huge lines, but it seems that computers can indeed be
helpful to humanity. Everything was fast and no annoyances. I'm
impressed.</p>

<p>Tomorrow may be a sad day for <a href="http://www.napster.com">Napster</a>.
Like they say,
<a href="http://gnutella.wego.com">"Hope for the best, prepare for worst"</a>.
This may mean that my ADSL may not be as useful as I'd like it to
be...</p>

<p>Another usual day, without much to say. I've been struggling to use
my University's network, but the system administrators take so
little care of it... What a pity. <img src="../../../smileys/sad.png" alt=":-(" /> My home system is in better
shape, actually (ok, but them I'm a nerd that almost lives for his
computer and that may be an excuse, but I thought that it was a
prerequisite for all system administrators to be one).</p>

<p>The catch is that I have to use that network to access some
academic databases and doing it at sane hours is painfully sloooow.
Pehaps other people are giving it more important uses, like
Napster.</p>

<p>The telco company was supposed to install my ADSL (256kbits down,
128kbits up) today, but, alas, they didn't. Apparently, they had a
problem with their central and after the modem was installed, it
didn't see the other side. Needless to say, I was quite angry with
this.</p>

<p>The technician will be coming tomorrow morning to finish the
installation.</p>

<p>Oh, I'm finally surfing the web at mach speed. Great. Ok, not so
great. My fuckning provider (which is not the same as the telco
co.) has my DNS entries messed up and I need to log in my
University's computer running SSH to stablish my SSH tunnel for
gathering my mail via POP.</p>

<p>After a lot of time doing this Combinatorial Optimization homework,
I found out that a lot of my colleagues didn't even bother to prove
that their algorithms worked, while I've spent a lot of time
finding algorithm invariants and proving that they were actually
maintained from interation to iteration. This is the Right
Thing(tm) to do, but it also takes a lot of time. What should I do
next time?</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'll have the "midterm" of Combinatorial Optimization.
It's not exactly a midterm, since it is considerably skewed towards
the end of the semester and I'll have 3 other tests until the
course is finished, but I guess that having this many tests is
actually better than having only two.</p>

<p>I'm terribly tired, sad (I'm not emotionally very well) and without
much motivation to study for my test. I have a reasonbly good grasp
of the theory, but some details of the subject didn't "sink in" up
till now and I'm not very much optimistic regarding what I can do
until tomorrow. In particular, finding negative cycles efficiently
(i.e., in polynomial time) is still a mystery for me. I have some
intuition of why the O(nm) algorithm works, but I have still to sit
down and write a complete, detailed a proof. I wish I had time.</p>

<p>I had the "midterm" today. I thought that while the subjects
covered were well chosen, it was not very well planned regarding
time. I mean, only 1h40min for all those proofs? A comfortable
period would be, say, 3h or 4h, but, then, maybe I'm a
perfectionist. Maybe I'm slow. Maybe both.</p>

Something must be wrong.</p>
