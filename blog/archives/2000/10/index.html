<p>Watched a tiny bit of the men marathon up to the point were the
African athletes won. This made me sleepy all the day. To make
matters worse, I woke up many times today. Noisy neighbors.</p>

<p>Election day today. It's funny that I thought I'd have problems
standing in huge lines, but it seems that computers can indeed be
helpful to humanity. Everything was fast and no annoyances. I'm
impressed.</p>

<p>Tomorrow may be a sad day for <a href="http://www.napster.com">Napster</a>.
Like they say,
<a href="http://gnutella.wego.com">"Hope for the best, prepare for worst"</a>.
This may mean that my ADSL may not be as useful as I'd like it to
be...</p>

<p>Another usual day, without much to say. I've been struggling to use
my University's network, but the system administrators take so
little care of it... What a pity. <img src="../../../smileys/sad.png" alt=":-(" /> My home system is in better
shape, actually (ok, but them I'm a nerd that almost lives for his
computer and that may be an excuse, but I thought that it was a
prerequisite for all system administrators to be one).</p>

<p>The catch is that I have to use that network to access some
academic databases and doing it at sane hours is painfully sloooow.
Pehaps other people are giving it more important uses, like
Napster.</p>

<p>The telco company was supposed to install my ADSL (256kbits down,
128kbits up) today, but, alas, they didn't. Apparently, they had a
problem with their central and after the modem was installed, it
didn't see the other side. Needless to say, I was quite angry with
this.</p>

<p>The technician will be coming tomorrow morning to finish the
installation.</p>

<p>After a lot of time doing this Combinatorial Optimization homework,
I found out that a lot of my colleagues didn't even bother to prove
that their algorithms worked, while I've spent a lot of time
finding algorithm invariants and proving that they were actually
maintained from interation to iteration. This is the Right
Thing(tm) to do, but it also takes a lot of time. What should I do
next time?</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'll have the "midterm" of Combinatorial Optimization.
It's not exactly a midterm, since it is considerably skewed towards
the end of the semester and I'll have 3 other tests until the
course is finished, but I guess that having this many tests is
actually better than having only two.</p>

<p>I'm terribly tired, sad (I'm not emotionally very well) and without
much motivation to study for my test. I have a reasonbly good grasp
of the theory, but some details of the subject didn't "sink in" up
till now and I'm not very much optimistic regarding what I can do
until tomorrow. In particular, finding negative cycles efficiently
(i.e., in polynomial time) is still a mystery for me. I have some
intuition of why the O(nm) algorithm works, but I have still to sit
down and write a complete, detailed a proof. I wish I had time.</p>

<p>I had the "midterm" today. I thought that while the subjects
covered were well chosen, it was not very well planned regarding
time. I mean, only 1h40min for all those proofs? A comfortable
period would be, say, 3h or 4h, but, then, maybe I'm a
perfectionist. Maybe I'm slow. Maybe both.</p>

<p>Today is election day again (the city where I live had a second
turn of elections) and surprisingly computers have helped again. I
thought the only thing they did was take our free time. It took me
less than one minute to vote and I didn't stand in line for hours.
Something must be wrong.</p>

<p>I also kept downloading more things from Napster. And my 13GB HD is
