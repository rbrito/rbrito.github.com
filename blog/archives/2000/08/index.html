<p>Took the day to go to my uncle's computer shop and installed
<a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a> Potato (which is a beta
release with final release quality) for him with Helix Code's
<a href="http://www.helixcode.com">Gnome</a>. This is the n-th attempt at
converting him to see the light, but, for some reason, it appears
that he was not as scared as in the previous attempts. Since my
trustworthy S3 Trio64+ is giving signals of its age, I got a newer
Tridend 3DImage750 to substitute it.</p>

<p>Oh, my! I stayed up to 7am without any sleep to get the card to do
just a sucky 1024x768x16bits with a similarly bad refresh rate. And
the card is sloooow. Or so it seems. But
<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> tells me other people are also
having problems with it, which makes me a little bit more
comfortable (at least I'm not going nuts thinking that I'm
consistently making stupid mistakes -- which are more common than
what I'd like to admit).</p>

<p>I guess that I should really take some time to experiment with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>. If not for anything else, it
seems that the system is so well documented that I found a site
pointed by their FAQ with an on-line engine that generated a
Modeline for whooping 1024x768 @85Hz with the Trident card. I had
never really pushed my monitor that far. On the low side, it seems
the Trident card is made by some RIAA people and just generates
some noise when I'm playing some MP3s. Looking forward to see if X4
can help me with acceleration.</p>

<p>After waking up at 2pm, I found myself pondering if I should or not
go to McDonald's to get those 10 Big Macs that mom had bought for
Mc Dia Feliz. I went and then, after being stuffed, went again to
my uncle's shop. I brought him my comp and he made a cool hack to
change my computer's battery. My computer seems happier and
healthier. Ok, not sure about happier, but it sure looks healthier.
And just found out that my uncle had a cool, brand-new
<a href="http://www.speedy.com.br">ADSL</a> installed in his office. Wow!
Those things kick some major ass! Downloading MP3s faster than I
can play them. It's officially a Good Thing(tm).</p>

<p>Still eating those Big Macs today. Made a home grown, bootable CD
of the relevant (for me, at least) part of Potato with some other
goodies. Struggled at first to get the bootable part going, but oh,
how I love available source code.</p>

<p>My mind is getting (even) fuzzier: haven't got enough sleep all
these days (an average of 5 or 4 hours) and this is really not
sufficient for me. This can be attributed to the huge number of
classes I'm now taking (6). Some of them are interesting, some are
not. And some were able to scare the shit out of me. I could be
taking yet another class if I were able to wake up on time today.
But I wasn't. I'll dump some of them anyway, but this week is quite
hectic. The problem is: there are still two days left for the
weekend, let alone the fact that I'll probably have to work this
Sunday. Oh, well...</p>

time (the last time, as I recall, was when I was just entering the

Ugh! Discovered that the
<a href="http://www.speedy.com.br">ADSL service I was planning to sign</a>
blocks incoming calls to SMTP and HTTP ports -- since I don't trust
anyone to receive and manage my e-mails, I had a plan of setting up
my own e-mail server. Fsck! If the providers can't get their
freaking job done The Right Way (tm), why do they prevent their
customers from doing it themselves?? It costs them absolutely
nothing. I mean <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>Also discovered that I'll have a class of "Probabilistic Method"
during my birthday and only this class. This means that I'll have
to endure hours of traffic just to get here to see the class and
then more painful hours to go back home.
