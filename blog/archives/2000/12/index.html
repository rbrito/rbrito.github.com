<p>After a long time without updates, I'm now back to "work".
<a href="http://www.vai.com">Steve Vai</a> is making some concerts here in São
Paulo, but unfortunately, I didn't attend it (the tickets' prices
were a bit on the steep side) and as I've just bought myself a new
new computer (woohoo), I'm saving a bit of money.</p>

<p>My new machine is a virgin <a href="http://www.amd.com">AMD</a> Duron 600MHz,
with an <a href="http://www.asus.com">Asus</a> A7V motherboard (which, among
other things, includes an UDMA/100 controller, FSB frequency
controls and multiplier control), 128MB of SDRAM/PC133, a great
<a href="http://www.matrox.com">Matrox</a> G400 card (monohead) with 16MB of
SGRAM and a <a href="http://www.samsung.com">Samsung</a> HD of 40GB.</p>

<p>I'm actually quite excited and aside from some problems that I had
with a defective Matrox (that I've now returned), it's working
wonderfully. It's so good that it even runs
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> quite fast! I can't wait for
<a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> 2.0.1 to be released on Monday (Dec 4th)
so that I can try the latest incarnation of
<a href="http://www.konqueror.org">Konqueror</a>.</p>

<p>BTW, <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> 2.8 was released today and
I've already downloaded a copy and burned onto CD. I think that
I've made everything right to get a bootable CD, but the CD that
I've made is only able to boot in my new computer. Strange.</p>

<p>And speaking of BSD, I also have <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>
4.2-RELEASE downloaded and burned. In fact, I think that I'm
spending way too much time with this Internet thing (I downloaded
FreeBSD the very same day it was released -- that's Nov 21st).</p>

<p>I'm now mirroring both a repository of
<a href="http://kde.tdyc.com">Debian KDE packages</a> for potato and
<a href="http://www.helixcode.com">Helix Gnome</a> for Debian with rsync. It's
<em>way</em> better than mirroring with wget, that's for sure.</p>

<p>I was expecting to go to the movies today, but due to some (ahem)
"technical problems", I wasn't able to go. And this made me quite
sad, but that's not actually a problem. Perhaps next week.</p>

<p>Repackaged <a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/">LAME</a> 3.87beta for
Debian/potato and it is lintian-clean (!). So far, it seems to be
good and I think that I'll post a message to debian-mentors asking
what could be improved. In fact, the only thing that I don't like
in my package is the fact that I've hardcoded a Build-Depends:
libncurses5-dev line in the control file. That's not quite right,
IMO, and I'll learn how to change it soon.</p>

<p>My next step is to package <a href="http://cr.yp.to/djb.html">DJB</a>'s
utilities qmail, ucspi-tcp, serialmail and checkpassword. The
former seems to be quite involved, but the latters seem to be
trivial enough to package in one afternoon only (am I optimistic or
what?) and then I'll be able to switch to my brand new computer
(MICROS\~1 free) with Debian 2.2 + KDE 2.2 + my local packages (I
still won't have XFree86 4.0.1 and all its nifty features, since
I'll be waiting for a version of it to be compiled for potato;
using woody is scary).</p>

<p>Another package that I may be interested in packaging is a
ftpparse-ified version of wget (for mirroring
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/publicfile.html">publicfile</a> repositories).</p>

<p>I can't believe, but I've packaged <em>all</em> those programs in just a
day. Granted, I was really tired when I finished and that was the
only thing I did today. But it was worth it, because now I can
migrate my computer to the new one quite easily (I really love
qmail and I sincerely depend on it to achieve happiness).</p>

<p>My qmail package is not as "clean" as I'd like it be (for instance,
it would be nice if I made its configuration use debconf, but I
think that that is a task for another day).</p>

<p>Today, <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE 2.0.1</a> was released. To be honest,
I didn't notice any changes between KDE 2.0.1 and KDE 2.0, but at
least the packages are newer and potentially contain new packaging
fixes also. So, I'm keeping it updated.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, I'm keeping a local mirror of it with rsync and
I'm planning on putting a CD with these sweet extra things for
Debian potato (and my locally packaged programs, of course). Now,
if I only could get XFree86 4.0.1 for potato, I'd be very happy.</p>

<p>The last day of classes of Computational Complexity. I'm both happy
and sad. I'm happy because it was quite demanding, with loads of
homework. But on the other hand, the subject is so cool and I'll
certainly miss it.</p>

<p>I plan to buy Papadimitrou's book "Computational Complexity", but I
must be sincere here and say that I'm quite scared of the sheer
amount of typos and small errors that this book contains. Indeed if
you ignore those errors, then the book is really good. I guess that
it needs a beta-testing phase as it is feature complete.</p>

<p>Woohoo! Got Debian's XFree86 4.0.1 packaged for potato. It's faster
with my Trident 3D Imàge 975 than XFree86 3.3.6, because it uses
more hardware acceleration (in fact, this was the main reason I
tried to find it).</p>

<p>Of course, it couldn't be a painless experience.</p>

<p>For configuration, dexter didn't work (it died reproducibly when I
was configuring it) and xf86cfg didn't work (I can't remember the
reason why it didn't work). So, I was "forced" to use X's internal
autoprobing. But then, my old, 2-button, serial mouse couldn't be
used with 3 button emulation. It took me a lot of time to figure
out how to do that (since the documentation -- both man pages and
extra documents -- don't mention it). After some painful hours,
I've discovered the magical line `Option "Emulate3Buttons"'. It
then worked.</p>

<p>But then, there were remaining problems: some dock WindowMaker
utilities were removed when I installed the new X (due to
dependendy problems). I had to recompile them. Then, rxvt was
strange. Recompile time again.</p>

<p>Now, everything seems fine. Another thing to throw on that "extras"
CD.</p>

<p>Went to a customer to upgrade his system, which was using a frozen
potato. I must confess that I love Debian indeed. The upgrades are
painless, fast, clean.</p>

<p>I also upgraded the kernel of the server from 2.2.16 to 2.2.18, now
that the stable Linux version was just released. And it performs so
well, serving files to a whole slew of MICROS\~1 machines, despite
the fact that it only has 32MB of memory. And even more remarkable
is the fact that it is a server running with lots of things
on-board. A quite modest machine. Getting its job done. Reliably.</p>
