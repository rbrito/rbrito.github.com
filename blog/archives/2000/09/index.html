<p>I haven't been having as much time to update my diary as I'd expect
to have, but I'm updating it in bursts as I can. Anyway, I strongly
suspect the world is keeping a secret conspiration against me. This
past week could surely be better. And to make matters worse, this
past night, just when I was going to sleep my brand new glasses got
broken. I'm now using some old glasses and I can't see very well.
The interesting thing: I didn't even pay all parcels of my new
glasses. I just wish I didn't have this huge shortsightedness.</p>

<p>Wow, what a day! I'm getting a bit older today. Some kind people
have sent me some cards (and some e-cards).</p>

<p>After the day began that way, I was pleased to learn that my
September issue of <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com">Linux Journal</a>
arrived.</p>

<p>Then, it was so nice to see a birthday present in form of a new
kernel (<a href="http://www.linux.com">Linux 2.2.17</a>) being released.
Hopefully it will make the feedback and VM system a bit easier on
the user (now, I just need
<a href="http://www.linux-ide.org">André Hedrick's IDE</a> patch and
<a href="http://devlinux.net/namesys/">Reiser FS</a> ported to 2.2.17). And
there's the news that <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> may be packaged to
<a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, now that Qt is being dually
licensed, which is übercool.</p>

<p>The day is not over yet and I just got my glasses fixed and now I
can see the world much clearer. Uh... If all days were like
this...</p>

<p>Yes, another week is about to begin. And I haven't slept today.
Yes, I'm tired. Yes, I'd like to be in bed.</p>

<p>This is "Classical" Music week. Beethoven's 5th piano concerto
today. Hummm! I love the first movement! Simply amazing.</p>

<p>My aunt's birthday today. Tried to call her, but who said it would
be possible?</p>

<p>It seems that a customer of mine that was giving me headaches when
I tried to receive for a job that I did for him (interconnecting
his computers with other places) finally gave up avoiding to pay
me. Nothing like a good threat.</p>

<p>One of my <a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~lymber/">best friends</a> (if not
the best) lent me some Vivaldi and I've ripped everything and
encoded with a version of <a href="http://www.sulaco.org/mp3/">LAME</a> that
I've packaged for Debian.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~jose/">advisor</a> and I decided that we
should start with my research. Now I need a subject.</p>

<p>The nice thing today is that I have slept for 14 hours. I needed
that. And I still need yet another dose of it.</p>

<p>It stinks to see that
<a href="http://www.ajato.com.br">broadbrand providers</a> don't know their
shit, when one asks them for it. When I asked them for some not so
standard technical details, the support got all confused (all of a
sudden the line becomes silent). Anyway, I could understand that
they don't provide me with a fixed IP (but what do they use? DHCP?
PPP-over-Ethernet?). I've sent them an e-mail. I know that I'll
receive a "canned" answer.</p>

<p>Reiserfs 3.5.25 is released and now I can upgrade my kernel to
2.2.17 with reiserfs and André's patch.</p>

<p>I've been listening to Vivaldi all day long today. Talking about
music, I want to order Agalloch's "Pale Folklore" from
<a href="http://www.theendrecords.com">The End Record</a>'s on-line form, but
it seems that their shopping cart doesn't get anything included
when I select the album (am I using it correctly?).</p>

<p>A new Gnapster is released and now I can connect to the main
<a href="http://www.napster.com/">Napster</a> server again. Woohoo.</p>

<p>It seems that my Mastership will have something to do with
phylogenetic trees. But that is only a wild guess. I'll have first
to understand the seemingly (for a Mathematician, at least)
confusing problems.</p>

<p>Still haven't received an answer for my e-mail to Ajato. So much
for a timely answer.</p>

<p><a href="../nectar/index.html">Nectar</a> is temporarily disabled. I'm still

<p>Still listening to "Classical" Music today: Symphony X and Yngwie

<p>For some reason, it seems that today I can order from The End

Fast and small. It seems that KDE 2 (now, also packaged for Debian)
is looking really promising. I mean: it's the 4th beta, but I
haven't had any problems using it for the last few hours. And
<a href="http://koffice.kde.org">Koffice</a> is also sweet.</p>

<p>Spent a good part of the day doing homework. Two of 'em, in fact.
One, due Monday. The other, due Tuesday. I'm more enthusiastic
about Combinatorial Optimization than programming Turing Machines,
but both classes I'm attending are cool. For someone that enjoys
theoretical Computer Science, that is. Amazingly, the theory is not
far from the Real World (tm).</p>

<p>An unusual day. First things first, I had the news that one of my
favourite sites, <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> was cracked
(<em>not</em> hacked) by some guys from Netherlands. According to the
reports from Slashdot themselves, it was their careless setting
that allowed that and that they've now learned the lesson and
secured their boxes. The sad state of computer security. Or
security in general.</p>

<p>I don't know what happened to my mind, but I cleaned my car. Hell's
temperature must be getting lower now.</p>

<p>Then I had to return a Celeron 400MHz that I was using to a place
<a href="http://www.linuxcenter.com.br">where I occasionally work</a>. It was
my guinea pig and I used it to test Debian's woody and, when I felt
brave, Linux 2.4 pre-releases. Now, I put my good, old, trustworthy
486 DX/2 66 back to use. It only has 8MB of RAM and a 120MB HD that
is not sufficient for demanding applications people use nowadays,
but I made a minimal install of Debian's slink and upgraded it to
potato (only 50 megs!), together with a custom compiled kernel.
Soon it will have 2 NICs and I'll use it as my router/firewall for
an ADSL connection (after Slashdot's fate, I'm willing to put a lot
of effort in the "firewall" part of it).</p>

<p>I took the time to see what loads it could handle and I'm more or
less satisfied with the results I got. I used it to transfer a 50MB
file to my Pentium MMX via
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/publicfile.html">publicfile</a> many times and it
sustained 550KB/s. While I suspect it will not handle the situation
so gracefully with 2 NICs, it seemed to me that the real bottleneck
for higher speeds was the disk task, which as a router is close to
zero.</p>

<p>All this means that I have no idea what I can expect from it. Oh,
well.</p>

<p>Finally went to catch a flick: "What Lies Beneath" (in Portuguese,
"Premonição"). It was supposed to be scary. Ok. Some parts were.
Came back home rightly after the movie was done (which means that
I'd like to get home not so fast next time).</p>
