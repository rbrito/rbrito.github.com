<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>These are some short notes on what I've doing these days.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there isn't much to talk about. I think that one of the most
relevant things that I did was to resurrect one of my best
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital%5Faudio%5Fextraction">audio-extracting</a> CD-ROM
drives: just opened the case of my computer, took off the CD drive, opened,
cleaned its lens, lubricated the moving parts and everything is back to
normal operation.</p>

<p>This sense of "getting something for nothing" is hard to explain to those
who have not experienced it already.</p>

<p>Other things that I did was to grab some old CDs that I had laying here
(Radiohead's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK%20Computer">OK Computer</a>, Pantera's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far%5FBeyond%5FDriven">Far Beyond Driven</a>, the tribute to Queen called "Dragon
Attack", and Gentle Giant's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free%20Hand">Free Hand</a>, among others). Dream
Theater's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic%5FChaos">Special Edition of Systematic Chaos</a>
is quite good, but unfortunately I don't have a 5.1 system at my disposal.</p>

<p>I also selected some material for further studies. I'm right now studying
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/group%20actions">group actions</a> (or G-sets as some seem to prefer). Soon, I
will be finishing the basics of Group Theory (hey, really, why is the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugacy_class">"Class Equation"</a> of
groups that "famous"? It is just a matter of saying that $|X| = \sum_{x\in
X} 1$, but with cardinality of orbits instead of with one's and with a
transversal of the orbits in place of $X$ itself).</p>

<p>Actually, if the orbits of the elements of the $G$-set $X$ consist of just
one element, then the equation above is the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action">"Class Equation"</a> (what
some people would call $\mathop{\mathrm{Fix}}(X)$, I would call the "orbits
being trivial").</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s_lemma">Burnside's
lemma</a> (which actually seems to be wrongly attributed, since it seems to
be discovered independently by Cauchy and Frobenius) for counting orbits of
a given action of a $G$-set has nice implications in combinatorics and it
should be, at least, mentioned in any self-respecting introduction to Group
Theory.</p>

<p>Oh, I almost forgot one of the major things that I did today (2007-06-12): I
finally learned how to manipulate the <a
href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt">quilt patch-system</a>
(initiated by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Morton_%28computer_programmer%29">Andrew
Morton</a>). The crucial point that is not written anywhere: the patches, by
default, are applied with <code>-p1</code> instead of <code>-p0</code>. This
took me quite some time to get, as the documentation isn't explicit about
it. Installation of quilt in a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">MacOS
X</a> system is not trivial, due to the demand of <a
href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</a> tools.</p>

<p>But now I can keep some <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> packages
of mine in a better shape than if I were just applying a single monolithic
patch.</p>
