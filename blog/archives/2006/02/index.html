<p>The world is full of people, of course. But only a handful of those
matter for us. And today I had the please of meeting one of those
special people, that makes the world go in an unexpected way, that
makes our head spin so madly without us knowing exactly why.</p>

<p>So much time has passed since I last felt this way and, to be
honest, I think that I could live my whole life this way.</p>

<p>Holy, shit! What a disasterous day: two car accidents in just one
day, mostly due to wandering around unknown and rainy places at
night (almost lost). This will cost me a good deal.</p>

<p>And, to boot it, my heart had an accident too. Oh.</p>

<p>On the bright side of things, teTeX 3.0 has entered testing, which
means quite a handful of new features and packages.</p>

<p>Today, most of <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> 2.12 has entered
testing, which is good. Also
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> 2.0.1 also entered.
Let's see if it plays some presentations that I have here that were
<em>slow</em> when played with OO.o 2.0.0.</p>

<p>Ugh! Paying through the roof for the mistakes made the other day.
An arm and a leg. <code>:-(</code></p>

<p>Hooray! Finally the Nightwish torrent from their 2003-06-20 show is
complete. It was a digital broadcast show and the quality is
amazing. I only had this one on a DivX file, but now that I have
the real thing, I will burn this one. The only "problem" is that it
only uses half of a DVD. Is there any way of putting another show
in a DVD, without having to author it and destroy its current
structure? That would definitely be nice.</p>

Just
(re)-<a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?introduction=yes">discovered</a>
that the Base35 set is already packaged in a neat way. The
available fonts are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>avant</code>: uses AvantGarde for sans-serif fonts</li>

<p>Got a new <a href="http://www.flash.net.br/">Internet</a> connection. It's
cable modem and the quality is variable. I'm still evaluating it,
though. Some problems like reverse-DNS not properly configured
comes to mind.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the DHCP connection is "authenticated" by the
MAC address of the card. When I showed that it was so easy to fake,
the cable guy didn't even believe what he saw. Is this bad news?</p>

<p>My car has almost turned junk due to vandalism of freshmen that
just got into the College. Poor souls. They don't know what to
expect when they take classes.</p>

<p>Due to the accident of yesterday, today I decided to take pictures
of my car, just as a proof of the damage made by mad freshmen.</p>

<p>A friend of mine has kindly helped with her camera and taking
pictures of the car. They are just scary. I just get the feeling
that I am living among wild, savage people.</p>

<p>And a neighbour of mine has kindly lent me his
<a href="http://www.samsung.com/">Samsung</a>
<a href="http://www.samsungcamera.com/">still camera</a> for me to take some
extra pictures, before going to the police. It is a Digimax A302,
with capacity of 3.2 megapixels.</p>

<p>I guess that, now, the
<a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/lpt/a/2849">Top Ten Digital Photography Tips</a>
will make more sense to me (along with reading the manual of the
camera). Oh, by the way, it worked fine with
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.16-rc3.bz2">2.6.16-rc3</a>'s
mass storage module loaded. No extra drivers needed. Nice toy. And
a nice operating system too.</p>

<p>Learning a bit more regarding photography in general. For instance,
now I know the difference between
<em><a href="http://www.storyphoto.com/journalism/phototip_nine.html">Slow Synchro</a> ("nighttime")</em>
and
<em><a href="http://www.storyphoto.com/journalism/phototip_five.html">Fill</a> ("forced")</em>
flash. It will be nice to be able to use them both when the
situations arise.</p>

<p>A student of mine has lent me his "Towers of Hanoi" puzzle so that
I can teach recursion for some students. The fact that recursion
works so well for some cases seems to be surprising (like
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">magic</a> or wizardry, sometimes) for
some students. They are not used to simple and elegant solutions to
some problems.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Victor!</p>

<p>Still trying to learn about digital photography. The subject is
fascinating. Too bad that I lack subjects to take pictures from,
but I guess that this is where the "artistic" part comes in.</p>

<p>Of course, the is also the "science" part of the thing, which is
where the knowledge comes in: choosing exposure, knowing what
lenses you should (or should not) use, seeing the appropriate flash
light settings etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many things are written in market-speak and it is
almost impenetrable for a layman to know exactly what is being
talked about.</p>

<p>I upgraded
<a href="ftp://ftp.matrox.com/pub/mga/archive/bios/2005/setup_258.exe">the firmware</a>
of my <a href="http://www.matrox.com/">Matrox</a>
<a href="http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/user_manuals/mill_g400/home.cfm">G400</a>
card to version 2.1.</p>

<p>Oh, I didn't know why my students were all excited to go home until
I realized that today was the first day of 2006's carnival.</p>

<p>Playing with <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>, I
discovered that the <a href="http://www.samsungcamera.org/">camera</a> saves
the pictures with "quality" settings of 95%, 85%, and 70% when
using "super fine", "fine", and "normal" settings for compression,
respectively. This answers one of the questions that I had in mind
when I started using this camera. Now, the other one is "which
resolution to use?".</p>
