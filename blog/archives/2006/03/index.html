<p>Nice. Let's see if this MathML thing works as intended: a b</p>

<p>Well, actually, it does. But only after I changed the extension of
the file from html to xhtml. What a crazy thing is this? What is
the purpose of that damned XML header on this file? Isn't it to
tell the damn server that this is an XML file? I suppose that the
server here may be broken.</p>

<p>Oh, and talking about broken things, my
<a href="http://www.flash.net.br/">cable modem</a> just got fried after
today's thunderstorm. Wow. Nice to have a backup plan.</p>

<p>One good thing to have in mind is that when one is minimally
serious about data structures, then on covering the topic of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash tables</a>, it is a
quite good chance to talk about the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox">"birthday paradox"</a>.
In the analogy, each day would correspond to a slot in the hash
table and each person would correspond to an item to be inserted
into the table.</p>

<p>If one takes this into account, the analysis of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox#Collision_counting">collisions</a>
is meaninful from a probabilistic point of view, which matters a
lot.</p>

<p>Changing the subject a little, in a replacement that lasted, say,
15 minutes (tops), the cable modem is back again working, which
means that playing with <a href="http://lartc.org/">tunneling</a> under
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a> (especially, using the IPSec
interface) is back again a possibility.</p>

<p>Oh, and it seems that <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu</a>'s
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases">dapper</a> is "mom proof".
Well, at least, she has been learning to use it with some hiccups,
but, then, personal computers aren't things with which she plays
everyday. She was surprised to know about
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and its broad coverage. And,
indeed, it is superb.</p>

<p>Discovered a great site for using Usenet (instead of using
<a href="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</a>): it's
<a href="http://www.aioe.org/">aioe.org</a>, which provides a nice opportunity
for those interested in serious discussions. What a terrific piece
of news!</p>

<p>I'm installing (at this <em>very</em> moment) a subset of
<a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive">TeX Live</a> for
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>. Let's see how it works compared
to the (already packaged) teTeX.</p>

<p>Today, I resurrected Loreena McKennitt's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mask_and_Mirror">"The Mask and Mirror"</a>
and it now plays without skipping in any place. It's so nice to
have it "back"...</p>

<p>I'm slowly progressing towards a better condition of my throat.
This is taking longer than what I expected.</p>

<p>Finally took some time to go to the police station to register the
damage done to my car.</p>

<p>Oh, and I got some new toys to play with, including a brand new
Firewire enclosure, wireless stuff and some DVD-R's. Fun ahead.</p>

<p>I've been (re-)discovering multimedia and all its wonders. It all
started with me seeing how <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>'s
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/frontrow.html">Front Row</a> application
works. Ok, so I am behind the times. I'm fine with that, but
catching up. The world is changing sooooo fast that it is hard to
keep up. Podcasts, wireless networks, media centers, digital video,
digital (still) cameras, megapixels and the like.</p>

<p>Add to that the things that "need to be known" by a Computer
Scientist/Mathematician-wannabe and we quickly arrive at the
conclusion that the days are way too short with their current 24
hours.</p>

<p>It, unfortunately, sucks and the fact that Apple is now "changing
gears" to support their <a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a>
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/intelcore.html">Core</a> processors is a
clear signal that their PowerPC line is dead and only waiting for
its coffin to be burried.</p>

<p>What the solution to this problem is? Partially, to employ Open
Source technology to leverage this to current standards, using
hardware that is already employed. We can <em>hardly</em>, expect the new
machines to outnumber the installed resources that we already have.
And have to keep working.</p>
