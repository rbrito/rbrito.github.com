<p>Had some programming session on working with
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/hfsprogs">hfsprogs</a>'s packaging for
Debian. I finally saw how to build a multi-arch building and
introduced some cruft to compile it under amd64 (aka,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86-64</a>), since
<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>'s code is
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/436159">not 64-bit clean</a>. Ugh!</p>

<p>And that's because they have the guts to show us their source code.
Imagine what a disaster it is to see proprietary software that is
completely closed!</p>

<p>Spent some time working on what to talk on the seminar in Error
Correcting Codes. Since the audience isn't that experienced with
programming, I will have a lot of background to cover like what a
simplified computer architecture is, what are the usual program
constructs in a high-level language, how the complexity of an
algorithm is evaluated, asymptotic notation, examples of some
algorithms relevant to this audience, like the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor">greatest common divisor</a>
by Euclid's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">Algorithm</a> and
Lamé's theorem. Of course, it is particularly important to cover
the methods of multiplication of matrices like Strassen's
Algorithm.</p>

<p>Didn't sleep too much today (actually I spent the whole night awake
trying to understand the simple program presented on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> for the generation of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_series">Farey Series</a> (as Hardy
&amp; Wright call them). Finally, looking at my copy of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics">"Concrete Mathematics"</a>,
I discovered a "bonus problem" (read: a very hard problem) that has
a deceivingly simple solution that I was looking for the past few
days to justify the program correctness.</p>

<p>Latter, I went with my dad to "Galeria do Rock" to grab myself a
copy of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_of_Salvation">Pain of Salvation</a>'s
"Be" (DVD+CD),
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristania_(band">Tristania</a>)'s

<p>Didn't sleep too much today (2nd day in a row!), since I was
watching one of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Theater">Dream Theater</a>'s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Theater#Bootleg_culture">official bootlegs</a>,
"When Dream and Day Reunite". (It was <em>cold!</em> in the morning).</p>

<p>But this was after I spent a very good amount of time
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>-packaging the upstream source code
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAME">LAME</a> (to which I have
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">CVS</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(data_management">commit access</a>)).
It now passes almost every
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lintian">lintian</a> check, besides the
fact that the <code>config.sub</code> and <code>config.guess</code> scripts have
time-stamps in the year of 2003. But I am not changing that (yet).</p>

<p>Now I am using my own dog-food, instead of relying on Christian
Marillat's precompiled versions of lame. And I even provided some
compatibility/transitional packages, so that packages like his
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ffmpeg">ffmpeg</a> with newer and nicest
improvements of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAME">LAME</a> (like
fractional
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_bitrate">variable bitrate</a>
qualities).</p>

<p>This means, in particular, that I can use better
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">MP3</a> sounding tracks for
videos.</p>

<p>And the good news is that, according to
<a href="http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/">Hydrogenaudio</a>, there is finally a
release of the lossy (but almost non-lossy!) compressor for audio
streams, called
<a href="http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=LossyWAV">lossyWAV</a>.
It surely seems quite promising.</p>

<p>Oh, and I finally discovered that the last show to which I went was
a looong time ago:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters_of_Rock#1998_3">Monsters of Rock Festival, September 24 1998</a>.
I was there to see Dream Theater, Megadeth, and Slayer, but some of
the people that were with me didn't like Slayer, unfortunately and
they wanted to exit the venue after I negotiated that I was there
to listen to, at least, "Raining Blood". Oh, Manowar was a joke.
Hilarious. I don't know if they take themselves seriously or not,
but they were ridiculous. This was the first time where I thought
of writing a program with a stochastic grammar to generate lyrics
for such stereotyped metal.</p>

<p>Had a most pleasant night with one of my dearest friends. Every
single second was worth it and it is too bad that I couldn't go to
the meeting earlier. Getting to the destination was much easier
than I thought and, luckily, the traffic didn't interfere (which,
BTW, is getting out of hand).</p>

<p>Anyway, I wished that those moments were repeatable <em>ad eternum</em>.
Yes, it was that good.</p>

<p>Seeing one of the <a href="http://www.dreamtheater.net/">Dream Theater</a>'s
<a href="http://www.ytsejamrecords.com/">Official Bootlegs</a> (and some of
their regular releases), I can't fail to notice that they have the
2.0 Stereo part as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPCM">LPCM</a> audio.
Sometimes, these streams are in 24 bits. I would like to convert
them to WAV files so that I can use <a href="http://lame.sf.net/">LAME</a> to
get the recordings on my portable digital music player.</p>

<p>To this effect, I spent some moments coding a program that I called
<code>lpcm2wav</code> that takes a raw input of an LPCM audio from a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD">DVD</a> video disc and outputs a
WAV file suiltable for compression (in 48kHz, normally).</p>

<p>Today was seminar day. I gave my talk about a brief introduction to
Algorithm Analysis and I covered topics: a simplified computer
architecture (with special attention to the role of the memory and
of the CPU), a simple program for computing squares of integers and
the concept of iteration, the accounting of steps of the program
(which results in a linear polynomial in the number of squares
printed), the fact that we can ignore constants when doing analysis
of algorithms and asymptotic notation (O, <code>\Omega</code>, <code>\Theta</code>, o,
<code>\omega</code>, <code>\sim</code>). Statement of the Prime Number Theorem in terms of
asymptotic notation. Comments regarding difficulties of factoring
integers, despite tests for primality being "easy".</p>

<p>It seems that I didn't scare people when talking such things, and
that they felt like they understood what I said, which is good,
since there are often conflicts between the language that Computer
Science people (mainly the "practical people") use and the language
that Mathematicians use. Since I am mostly in the middle, I think
that I can talk with both without problems (but this means that I
am not an specialist in anything, alas).</p>

<p>Got myself a leaner
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20system">operating system</a>
without a heavy graphics interface: just fluxbox. This means that I
am able now to see how slow Iceweasel is, especially when switching
virtual desktops. <code>:-(</code></p>

<p>I also was happy to see that
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/hfsprogs">hfsprogs</a> version 334.14-3
migrated to testing (and I wasn't expecting that---I completely
forgot about this since I'm using unstable exclusively).</p>

<p>Prepared a new version of <code>hfsprogs</code> with more support for 32-bit
architectures supported by <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and
with initial support for <code>amd64</code>. Rhonda has been helping me a lot
understanding the infra-structure behind Debian.</p>

<p>Oh, discovered what it takes to make an Apple "Universal" binary:
just compile <code>program.c</code> with the options
<code>-arch i386 -arch ppc -arch ppc64</code> like:</p>

<pre><code>gcc -arch i386 -arch ppc -arch ppc64 program.c -o program

<p>Gave a second talk to the group of "Error Correcting Codes". This
time, I carried my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S1MP3">S1MP3</a>
player/recorder and recorded the talk. The nice thing is that
<a href="http://lame.sf.net/">LAME</a> with libsndfile1 can read those files
directly, without any kind of conversion first, which automates
things quite a lot.</p>

<p>During the seminar, I talked about algorithm invariants, how to
discover them, how close to mathematical induction they are, gave
examples of some programs, described the bubble sort algorithm in
our native/high level language, talked about its stability, talked
about its invariant, talked about its time and space complexity,
remarked that the algorithm works on any totally ordered set and,
finally, to answer a question from the audience, talked about the
limited precision of "integers" that we use on computers and
multiprecision libraries used to hold values as large as we
please.</p>
