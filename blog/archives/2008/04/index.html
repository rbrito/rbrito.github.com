<p>During he past few days, I have been writing (in
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, of course!) some (very)
elementary notes on Elementary Number Theory, after starting to
read the classic book "Introduction to Number Theory", by Hardy &amp;
Wright. The reasons for me taking such notes are threefold:</p>

<ul>
<li>To know how much I retained of the content of my studies and to
serve as a reference for future for facts that I will surely
forget.</li>
<li>To provide a text that has a language different from the book,
which, while quite good, uses old-fashioned terms (e.g., they use
consistently the word "aggregate" for the word "set").</li>
<li>To provide both some algorithmic aspects of Elementary Number
Theory that are usually not covered in similar texts (while there
is quite a lot of room for the computational side of things) and to
provide multiple proofs (where I know them) of theorems, which
serve to illuminate the understanding of facts and see connections
with other fields.</li>
</ul>


<p>Today I got a phone call from a <em>very</em> dear friend of mine. I
<a href="http://www.floresonline.com.br/">sent her flowers and chocolate</a>
as a birthday gift.</p>

<p>Went to my University to go to the library and there was a seminar
there. I stayed after being kindly asked by the professor that
coordinates the seminar. <code>:-)</code></p>

<p>After that, I decided that it would be nice to go to the library to
visit once more the section of Number Theory. I was aware that
Diophantine equations were important. But I just didn't know that
elliptic curves are Diophantine equations. And the subject is
dense.</p>

<p>By the way, talking about Number Theory, I'm starting to feel the
need of studying some Mathematical Analysis: the whole area of
Analytic Number Theory is alien to me and it shouldn't be (for a
person that aims at knowing the basics of Number Theory). Actually,
I can't even recall some basic facts from my calculus courses. I
think that it is high time for a refresher.</p>

<p>Actually got <a href="http://lame.sf.net/">LAME</a> compiling. I sent earlier
a patch to Robert to fix the compilation with
<a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/">libsndfile</a>. This new
version of LAME is getting quite good. I think that soon we will
have the 3.98 release out there and maybe it is time for me to get
the debian directory in shape.</p>

<p>Spent some time polishing my <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>
package for <a href="http://cr.yp.to/">qmail</a>, with the patches managed by
quilt. Now, everything is more maintainable, despite the fact that
separating one monolithic patch into smaller patches was a pain.</p>

<p>I finally got some time to experience
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.org/">Ubuntu</a>'s latest distribution on my iBook.
Unfortunately, there seems to be serious problems with the live CD
as X isn't working correctly. <code>:-(</code>. I still don't know what could
be the cause, since the framebuffer was set at 1024x768, but X
insisted on the resolution being 800x600.</p>

<p>Upgraded my parent's computer from
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>'s Feisty (7.10) to Hardy (8.04).
Now, some of the things that I'm used to when using
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>'s sid are available on their
computer.</p>

<p>Oh, I can't avoid to use this opportunity to complain once more
about my <a href="http://www.flash.net.br/">ISP</a>. If I weren't doing the
upgrade <strong>really</strong> early in the morning, I wouldn't have success,
as I am (right now), without signal from them. These outages are
getting on my nerves.</p>

<p>In some math related news, I finally saw a proof of the intuitive
fact the determinant of a 2x2 matrix is the signed area of the
parallelogram with vectors given by the column vectors of the
matrix.</p>

<p>Also, my D-Link G122 (I think that that's the model) doesn't work
with the <code>rt2500usb</code> driver that ships with the distribution: I can
see that <code>iwconfig</code> lists <code>wlan0</code> as having wireless extensions, I
can set the device, it can see the access point, I can enter the
WEP key, but it doesn't seem to get a DHCP lease from the router.
<code>:-(</code></p>
