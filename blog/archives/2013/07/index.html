</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>Not so much ago, we had a boom of new enterprises offering Massive Online
Open Courses (MOOCs for short).</p>

<p>First were Thrun and Norvig (Artificial Intelligence), with Widom
(Introduction to Databases) and Ng (Machine Learning). Then, these initial
experiments led to the creation of Udacity (founded by Thrun) and Coursera
(founded by Ng and Koller).</p>

<p>I have been keeping an eye on them for some time and, in fact, I have been
contributing to a project similar to <a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl">youtube-dl</a> (which
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/youtube-dl">I package for Debian</a>), but focused on downloading videos from
Cousera, called <a href="https://github.com/jplehmann/coursera"><code>coursera-dl</code></a>.</p>

<p>I started contributing to <code>coursera-dl</code> because I wanted to stratch some
itches with downloading with <a href="http://aria2.sourceforge.net/"><code>aria2c</code></a>, but soon the original
author of the project granted me write permission to the repository and I
have been one of the persons that commits the most, which is strange, since
I was not the original creator of the program.</p>

<p>So far, from the courses that grant certificates, I have concluded the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 (Coursera)</li>
<li>Machine Learning (Coursera)</li>
<li>Introduction to Databases (Coursera)</li>
<li>Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation (Coursera)</li>
<li>Introduction to Cryptography I (Coursera)</li>
<li>M101P: MongoDB for Developers (10gen)</li>
<li>M102: MongoDB for DBAs (10gen)</li>
<li>M101J: MongoDB for Java Developers (10gen)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have to say that this have been a pleasant experience, with some of the
courses being challenging, but not up to what an undergraduate course would
be (and the fears of some people that such courses would threaten the
conventional University-style model are a bit far at this point).</p>

<p>Anyway, talking about challenging courses, in particular, prof. Umesh
Vazirani's "Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation" had a lot of
(computational) work and this was one of the courses that prompted me to use
a computer algebra system for manipulating some tedious calculations.</p>

<p>In particular, I used a mix of the <a href="http://www.sagenb.org/">online SAGE math server</a> and
<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a>, whichever I found the syntax to be easier to use for
the problem in question. It is with happiness that I see that there are
efforts to <a href="http://people.debian.org/~thansen/debian-sage-status.html">get SAGE again packaged in Debian</a>.</p>

<p>Another (positively) surprising course has been Dan Boneh's "Introduction to
Cryptography I", which was more theoretical and more serious than what I was
expecting. It even included some nice proof sketches and discussion of
recent results. The last course on cryptography that I took was in 1998 and
<em>a lot</em> of things changed since then, including the way to think about
cryptography. But more on that on a future post.</p>

<p>There are some other courses that I may be completing soon and that I will
post more about, with some reviews of the good and the bad parts of select
ones.</p>

<a href="../../../posts/beginning_ruby/">Beginning Ruby</a>

</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>These are some very rough/sketchy notes that I took while doing the
exercises on the introductory track of the Ruby language at
<a href="http://www.codeacademy.com/">codeacademy</a>.  They were written from the point-of-view of an amateur
programmer in C and Python (read: "me").</p>

<p>Since this is my first time with Ruby and I only have about 1 week of
experience with it, these notes are likely to contain many mistakes, many
simplifications, many omissions or simply gross errors.  I would love to be
informed of such facts so that I can fix them and not write code that is
burdensome for others to maintain.</p>

<h1 id="operators">Operators</h1>

<ul>
<li>Math operators: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>**</code> (just like Python)</li>
<li>Relational operators: <code>==</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code> (just like other
languages)</li>
<li>Boolean operators: <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>!</code> (just like C/C++/Perl)</li>
<li>The combined comparison operator ("spaceship operator", like Perl): <code>&lt;=&gt;</code>
(follows the spirit of what <code>strcmp</code> in C does)</li>
<li>Conditional assignment operator (<code>||=</code>) only assigns a value to a variable
if that variable is bound to <code>nil</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="numbers">Numbers</h1>

<ul>
<li>You can write number literals embedding an underscore (<code>_</code>) for
readability purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="basicio">Basic I/O</h1>

<ul>
<li>Output: <code>print</code> and <code>puts</code>. Both print strings to stdout, but <code>puts</code> also
appends a new line to the end.</li>
<li>Input: <code>gets</code> accepts an input from stdin and returns a string.</li>
<li>To convert a string <code>foo</code> to an integer, use the <code>Integer(foo)</code>
constructor. It throws an exception if it cannot convert the value.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="strings">Strings</h1>

<ul>
<li>Strings have at least some methods: <code>.length</code>, <code>.reverse</code>, <code>.upcase</code>,
<code>.downcase</code>, <code>.capitalize</code>, <code>.chomp</code> (like Perl, removes the trailing
endline)</li>
<li><code>.upcase</code> seems to have problems with non-ASCII characters, like <code>é</code>.</li>
<li>Interpolation is performed by putting the name <code>name</code> of the variable
inside a string and delimited as <code>#{name}</code> at the place we want the
interpolation to occur.</li>
<li>Methods like <code>.capitalize</code> don't change the string (they return a new
string capitalized).  To change the string, you call the method
<code>.capitalize!</code> (with a <code>!</code> at the end of the name of the method).</li>
<li>Other useful methods: <code>.gsub</code> for globally substituting a regular
expression (and its variant <code>.gsub!</code> for inplace modification), and
<code>.include?</code> to verify if the first string includes another.</li>
<li>Another method: <code>.split(" ")</code>, to split on the string specified as
argument.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="controlflow">Control flow</h1>

<h2 id="if">If</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The syntax of a <code>if</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>if expression1
  block1
elsif expression2
  block2
else
  block3
end
</code></pre>

<p>note that it ends with the word <code>end</code>, there are no need for parentheses,
no braces, no colons, and the keyword for "else if" is <code>elsif</code> (different
from Python's <code>elif</code>).</p></li>
<li>The "<code>if</code>" can also be started with the keyword <code>unless</code> instead, which
checks if the expression is false rather than true (as is the case of
<code>if</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="while">While</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The syntax of the <code>while</code> is similar to other languages:</p>

<pre><code>while condition
  block
end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>A variation of the <code>while</code> is the <code>until</code>, with the same syntax, except
for the <code>until</code> in place of the while, and that it iterates when the
condition is false, instead of true.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="for">For</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The simple case of iterating over a range of numbers is:</p>

<pre><code>for i in 1...10
  block
end
</code></pre>

<p>Like ranges in Python, the 10 is not included (the variable <code>i</code> iterates
from 1 to 9).</p>

<p>For an <em>inclusive</em> range, we use two dots (<code>1..10</code>), instead of three
dots (<code>1...10</code>).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="loop">Loop</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>To iterate a block, we can use the <code>loop</code> keyword, as in:</p>

<pre><code>loop { block } # with braces
</code></pre>

<p>or as in</p>

<pre><code>loop do # note the pair do/end in place of braces
  block
end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>It is useful to use <code>break</code> when using loop to break out of the infinite
iterations.</p></li>
<li>Similarly, we can use <code>next</code> as in other languages (the same as <code>continue</code>
in C or C++).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="arrays">Arrays</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>The equivalent to Python's lists are arrays and they are declared in the
same fashion:</p>

<pre><code>my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Arrays in Ruby are 0-based.</p></li>
<li><p>Every array has an iterator called the <code>.each</code> method. The basic syntax
is:</p>

<pre><code>object.each { |item| block } # do something
</code></pre>

<p>which can be written as:</p>

<pre><code>object.each do |item| block end
</code></pre>

<p>where the name between <code>| |</code> is bound to (a copy of?) each element of
<code>object</code> in turn. The equivalent in Python would be:</p>

<pre><code>for item in object:
    block
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Arrays can be sorted with the <code>.sort</code> method (or its sibling <code>.sort!</code>).
When passing a parameter, it is useful to use the spaceship operator
(<code>&lt;=&gt;</code>) (like Perl) to specify a custom order (similar in spirit to what
we do with Python's <code>key</code> argument to the <code>sort</code> method of a list).
Example:</p>

<pre><code> my_array.sort! {|a, b| a &lt;=&gt; b} # Ascending order
 my_array.sort! {|a, b| b &lt;=&gt; a} # Descending order
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The <code>.push</code> method appends an element to an Array (similar to Python's
<code>.append</code>).</p></li>
<li>The empty Array is denoted by <code>[]</code>, like an empty list in Python.</li>
<li>An iterator (like <code>(1..10)</code>) can be converted to an array with the <code>.to_a</code>
method.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="hashes">Hashes</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>A literal hash is defined by the syntax:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash = {
    "key1" =&gt; "abc",
    "key2" =&gt; 2,
    "key3" =&gt; false
}
</code></pre>

<p>Quite similar to the version in Python:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash = {
    "key1": "abc",
    "key2": 2,
    "key3": False
}
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, in Ruby 1.9, you can write, instead:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash = {
    key1: "abc",
    key2: 2,
    key3: false
}
</code></pre>

<p>which is very similar to Python or JSON.</p></li>
<li><p>The empty hash, OTOH, is defined by calling the constructor <code>.new</code> of the
class <code>Hash</code>:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash = Hash.new
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax used by Python can also be used: <code>my_hash = {}</code></p></li>
<li><p>Iterating over a hash is done the same way as done for an array, but the
<code>.each</code> method gives <em>both</em> the key <em>and</em> the value, as in:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash.each do |k, v|
  puts "#{k}: #{v}"
end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To iterate only on keys, we use the method <code>.each_key</code>. To iterate only on
values, we use the method <code>.each_value</code>.</p></li>
<li>A hash can be sorted with the <code>.sort_by</code> method (to sort by keys, values
or any expression involving them) and since it can be ordered, we can
reverse (in-place) the order of its elements with the <code>.reverse!</code> method.
This makes Ruby's hashes to "taste" like Python's <code>OrderedDict</code>'s.</li>
<li>When one initializes a hash, one can specify a default value to the <code>.new</code>
method (e.g., <code>foo = Hash.new(0)</code>), which makes it convenient to do the
equivalent of Python's <code>defaultdict</code> or <code>Counter</code>.</li>
<li><p>You can select part of a hash by using the <code>.select</code> method and giving it
a block. For example:</p>

<pre><code>good_movies = movie_ratings.select{|k, v| v &gt; 3}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="functionsmethods">Functions/methods</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Functions in Ruby are defined with the word <code>def</code> (as in Python) and end
with the word <code>end</code>, as other composite constructs. Example:</p>

<pre><code>def square(n)
  return n*n
end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Parentheses are optional in Ruby, unless they create ambiguity. So, to
call the function above, one can use any of the following:</p>

<pre><code>square(2)
square 2
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>A function can take a block as a parameter (and this is what <code>.each</code> does,
for instance).</p></li>
<li>Functions can take a variable number of elements with the <em>splash</em>
operator (denoted by <code>*</code>), which puts the extra parameters in an Array
(like Python).</li>
<li>Functions can have default parameters, which are set in the "prototype",
just like in Python or C++.</li>
<li>If the <code>return</code> keyword is omitted from the method, Ruby uses an implicit
return, where the value of the last executed expression is returned to the
caller of the method.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="symbols">Symbols</h1>

<ul>
<li>Any instances of a given symbol share the same ID. This is due to the fact
that they are immutable.</li>
<li>Symbols start with a colon (<code>:</code>) and they can contain any character that
is valid for a variable name.</li>
<li>It is possible to convert between a symbol and a string with the methods
<code>.to_s</code> and <code>.to_sym</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="comments">Comments</h1>

<ul>
<li>Single line comments use the hash symbol (<code>#</code>).</li>
<li>Ruby also has multiline comments, which are delimited by a line beginning
with <code>=begin</code> and a line beginning with <code>=end</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="lambdafunctions">Lambda functions</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>A lambda function in Ruby is defined, as expected, as, for example:</p>

<pre><code>foo = lambda { |x| x.to_sym }
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The basic differences between a lambda and a proc is that:</p>

<ul>
<li>A lambda checks the number of elements that it receives, while a proc
doesn't and assigns <code>nil</code> to parameters that it didn't receive (a proc
seems to ignore extra parameter that it wasn't expecting).</li>
<li>When a lambda returns, the control goes back to the function that called
the lambda, while when a proc returns, the control is returned <em>also</em>
from the function that called the proc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="classes">Classes</h1>

<ul>
<li>"Everything is an object in Ruby." (At least one exception are blocks).</li>
<li>To test if an object is of a given class, you use the method <code>.is_a?</code> on
the object and the type as argument (e.g., <code>foo.is_a? Integer</code>)</li>
<li>The "null" value in Ruby is <code>nil</code>. It is equivalent to <code>None</code> in Python.</li>
<li>The only "falsy" values in Ruby are <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code>. The others are
"truthy", differently from C/C++/Perl/Python.</li>
<li>For a given object, the method <code>.object_id</code> returns what is the "address"
of that object.</li>
<li><p>Classes in Ruby are created with the syntax</p>

<pre><code>class ClassExample
    # body
end
</code></pre>

<p>(That is for a class that has is not derived from other regular classes).</p></li>
<li>Constructors in Ruby are called <code>initialize</code>. An instance of a class is
created by calling the method <code>.new</code> on the class name (and passing
parameters as needed for the <code>initialize</code> method).</li>
<li>Instance variables are named with 1 at sign (<code>@</code>) as a prefix. Class
variables are named with 2 at signs (<code>@@</code>) as a prefix. Global variables
are named with a dollar sign (<code>&#036;</code>) as a prefix.</li>
<li>Class methods are declared inside a class prefixed with <code>self.</code> and they
are called with the class name suffixed with the name of the method. For
example, for a class <code>MyClass</code>, with a class method <code>class_method</code>, we
call it as <code>MyClass.class_method</code>.</li>
<li>When overriding a method in a subclass, one can call the method from the
parent class with the keyword <code>super</code>, as in <code>super(arg1, arg2)</code>.</li>
<li>Ruby doesn't support multiple inheritance. In place of multiple
inheritance, Ruby offers mixins.</li>
<li><p>To access one attribute, say <code>@my_attrib</code>, in Ruby classes, one usually
creates two methods to manipulate it: a method with the name <code>my_attrib</code>,
that returns the value of <code>@my_attrib</code> (a getter) and a method with the
name <code>my_attrib=</code> that accepts a parameter to set <code>@my_attrib</code> to (a
setter).</p>

<p>There is syntatic sugar for creating both getters or setters.</p>

<p>For a getter, you declare <code>attr_reader :my_attrib</code> (the member name as a
symbol).</p>

<p>For a setter, you declare <code>attr_writer :my_attrib</code>.</p>

<p>If you need both a getter and a setter, then you can abbreviate them with
<code>attr_accessor</code>.</p></li>
<li>All methods, by default, are public in Ruby. To explicitly mark something
as public, you use the keyword <code>public</code>. To mark something as private, you
use the keyword <code>private</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="modules">Modules</h1>

<ul>
<li>You can import a module with the keyword <code>require</code> (as in Perl) and the
name of the module in quotes.</li>
<li>One example of a module is the <code>benchmark</code> module, which provides the
<code>Benchmark</code> class, which has the method <code>.realtime</code>, which takes a block
and reports how much time it used.</li>
<li>To create a module, use a syntax similar to that of a class, but
substituting the keyword <code>class</code> with <code>module</code>.</li>
<li>The scope resolution operator in Ruby is the double colon (<code>::</code>), like in
Perl.</li>
<li><p>To create a method inside a module, you have to prefix it by the name of
the module with a dot or with <code>self.</code>, if you want to create a method to
be called outside the module.</p>

<p>The same also holds for creating class methods (as opposed to <em>instance</em>
methods): they can be simply named <code>self.foo</code> to get a class method called
<code>foo</code>.</p></li>
<li>While some modules are already "preloaded" by the interpreter (e.g.,
<code>Math</code>), others need to be explicitly loaded. We do this by using <code>require
'foo'</code> to load the module (in the file <code>foo</code>?).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="mixins">Mixins</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>A mixin is the use of a module to "enrich" a class, adding "instance"
methods of the module to the class.</p>

<p>It is, in a sense, a way to have some of multiple inheritance in Ruby
(without its headaches?)</p></li>
<li>Using the word <code>include Foo</code> imports the items of the module <code>Foo</code> in the
current namespace for <em>instances</em> of a class.</li>
<li>Using the word <code>extend Foo</code> imports the items of the module <code>Foo</code> in the
current namespace as class methods/attributes.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conventions">Conventions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Local variables are named in lower case, with parts separated by
underscores, as in <code>my_name</code>.</li>
<li>Methods that return boolean values have a question mark (<code>?</code>) at the end
of their name.</li>
<li>Methods that have destructive side-effects (like changing their input)
have an exclamation mark (<code>!</code>) at the end of their name.</li>
<li>Code is indented by 2 spaces.</li>
<li>Like other languages, constants are written in all caps, with words
separated by underscores. For example, <code>MAX_VALUE</code>.</li>
<li>Global variables are prefixed with a dollar sign (e.g., <code>&#036;Foo</code>).</li>
<li>Classes are named in camel case (no initial lowercase).</li>
<li>The "poetic mode" in Ruby recommends one to omit the parentheses on
function calls (whenever unambiguous) and, in essence, to write as little
"bureaucracy" (like the explicit <code>return</code> keyword in methods).</li>
</ul>
