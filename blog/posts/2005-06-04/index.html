<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content">
<p>Today I bought some books at Pearson Education. They were not that
cheap, but I think that some of their content is worth the amount
spent. During the time I was there, BTW, I met 8 colleagues (at
least, that I could count). So much for coincidence. <img src="../../smileys/smile.png" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>After that, I went to Santa IfigÃªnia to get myself an used Duron
1.3GHz processor (actually, I went there to get conductive ink so
that I could overclock my Duron 600MHz processor). Unfortunately, I
can't make it work with anything higher than 1.1GHz on my
motherboard (an old classic Asus A7V). Bummer.</p>

<p>Spent the whole day trying to make my system work as it always did.
I now suspect that I need some RAM, but I am not forking the cash
for PC133 modules right now (my budget is now tight).</p>
