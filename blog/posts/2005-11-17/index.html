&gt; I would say that many people learn LaTeX the wrong way: getting a poorly
&gt; designed document and just changing it quickly until it contains more or
&gt; less what the person wants it to have.
&gt;
&gt; This is wrong in, at least, two aspects:
&gt;
&gt; 1 - this is not in line with the philosophy of LaTeX of separation of
&gt;     content and presentation (which was here for a loooong time before
&gt;     people in the Web decided to use Cascading Style Sheets with their
&gt;     pages and all the technology that accompanies XML);
&gt;
&gt; 2 - as an extension of point 1, I'd say that writers should learn at
&gt;     least a modicum of how to use LaTeX macro, so that they create new
&gt;     environments for their necessities instead of hardcoding things.
&gt;
&gt;     See, if you have a good macro, you can even put that in a style file
&gt;     of your own and forget about formatting something in that way in the
&gt;     future. In this sense, you can regard your style file as a "library"
&gt;     (in the computer programming sense) of distilled knowledge.
&gt;
&gt;     And this also implies that a good approach to using LaTeX is to
&gt;     regard the text as "the source code" of your text and even use tools
&gt;     like control revision systems (e.g., RCS, CVS, Subversion etc).
&gt;
&gt; &gt; "apt-get install" is great here, since installing from source has got
&gt; &gt; to be a nightmare.
&gt;
&gt; Don't forget to install tetex-doc and use the "TeX Catalogue on-line"
&gt; for looking for packages to accomplish what you want. Also, a *very*
&gt; good source of information here is the UK TeX FAQ (search in Google).
&gt; Not only it is very good, but it is quite entertaining.

Thanks Rogerio

I flirted with LaTex briefly, a while ago, but didn't get very far.
Your advice prompts me to revisit it :)
