<section id="content">
<p>These past days have been quite active for me. Lots of learning of
newer technologies (you know, those that will change soon and that
I wouldn'd classify as Computer Science, as, for me, Computer
Science is a sacred name).</p>

<p>One of these is things that I've been learning is about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process">Software Development Process</a>
and its variants, mostly focused on
<a href="http://agilcoop.incubadora.fapesp.br/">Agile</a> development.</p>

<p>The concepts involved are a mix of people management with the issue
of these new tools we call personal computers. This makes the
things studied, at the same time, general enough to be applied
wherever we have teams working for a common objective (and the
different approaches to reach the goals ranging from things where
everything is specified to where adaptation is the key word of the
project) and not "scientific", in the sense that the results can
hardly be reproduced in a lab.</p>

<p>Well, actually, <em>what</em> would be a lab in this case, where one of
the most crucial aspects is human behaviour and variables inserted
all the time? So, in a sense, if I were to put "Software
Development" in any "science" part of the human knowledge, then it
would be within
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities">Humanities</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences">Social Sciences</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the most important things that I reckon that have the
potential to "stand-out" of these moving targets we currently
witness are the collaborative methodology of work, including the
Wiki phenomenon (with the tools for such collaborative development,
like version control systems like
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>), and adaptation of
targets and goals.</p>
