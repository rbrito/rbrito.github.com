<p>Just when I thought that I had enough things to play with, I
discovered some great tools on the 'net.</p>

<p>The first of this (and what consumed me a good amount of time) is
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/pkfix-helper/">pkfix-helper</a>,
an auxiliary script for
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/pkfix/">pkfix</a> that
guesses the fonts used by old PostScript documents generated by
dvips with fonts that are scalable and that are much better to
transform to PDF format than bitmapped fonts. I even got some time
to write about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkfix">pkfix</a> so that
people get a better idea of what it is all about (the previous
version of the document was quite bad).</p>

<p>Another tool that I've been playing with are mind-mappers. One from
KDE (which I can't recall right now) and one implemented in Java,
called <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/">Freemind</a>. Using those
tools is quite fun and you also get a better idea of what you have
to do (say, using them as a task planner). Interesting stuff.</p>

<p>I just don't understand why it is listed in
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>'s contrib section, while it is
Free Software and its dependencies seem to be fulfiled with Free
Software only (remember that Java has, now, Free virtual
Machines).</p>
