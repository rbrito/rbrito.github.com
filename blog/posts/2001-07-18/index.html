<p>Ok, I know I messed up. My girlfriend told me that we were in July,
not June. What a shame! Anyway, I've corrected my diary entries and
got things straight (I think). I guess that the problem was that
both months start with a "J".</p>

<p>Now, to the next (and final?) chapter on the mac: I returned it to
my uncle and set up the other mac on his store just to see if I
could get Debian installed. Well, I kind of could: I got the
bootfloppies installed in 1GB HD and was very surprised to see an
almost entire setup with the network. Amazing. I'm almost without
words: just grab 4 FDs and install a whole operating system in your
machine with them. <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> definitely keeps
its lead over other distributions this way.</p>

<p>Well, enough ads. I could get almost everything installed, but the
HD died (for good?) soon after the packages were being extracted
onto the new filesystem. I tried the other (4GB) HD, but it wasn't
being seen by <code>mac-fdisk</code> for an unknown reason (despite it being
recognized during the SCSI bus scan and the partition check).</p>

<p>Well, I guess that I can consider this as my first installation of
Linux on a PowerPC architecture, which could not be concluded only
because the hardware didn't help, but both the operator (that's me!
<grin\>) and the software were right.</p>

<p>Watched "Monty Python's Life of Brian" after that. Sent both my VCR
and TV set to the technician. For some strange reason, both
<a href="http://www.konqueror.org">Konqueror</a> and
<a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a> are not rendering this page
justified, while <a href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape 4.77</a>,
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla 0.9.2</a> and
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Internet Explorer</a> are.</p>
