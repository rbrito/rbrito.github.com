<p>Have been playing with the great idea of
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2009/03/msg00210.html">caching</a>
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/318658/">deb</a> packages. I finally settled
for the option of using
<code>&lt;a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-ocaml-maint/packages/approx.git"&gt;approx&lt;/a&gt;</code>,
which does a really nice job of caching packages.</p>

<p>Actually, it fullfils quite a lot of requirements and even
surpasses some of my expectations:</p>

<ul>
<li>It supports multiple architectures (in fact, this is important
for me, as I use <code>i386</code>, <code>amd64</code>, and <code>powerpc</code>.</li>
<li>It can support multiple distributions (both different versions
of the same distribution and completely different distributions, as
long as they use a repository like
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>'s, as is the case of
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>).</li>
<li>It keeps its directory hierarchy neatly organized, like that of
Debian, in a package pool, which saves space and makes everything
easier and faster to find (and has the advantage of being fast with
filesystems that don't cope well with many entries in one
directory).</li>
</ul>


<p>The transition wasn't painless from
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/apt-move"><code>apt-move</code></a>, since apt-move
moves the files, but renames them in a way that they don't keep
epochs in their names, which makes <code>approx-import</code> moan about the
packages.</p>

<p>For places where I am too lazy to import the packages, I just
filled the cache redownloading the packages with something
approximately like this:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get -d --reinstall install $(dpkg -l | grep "^ii" | cut -d " " -f 3)
</code></pre>

<p>Well, I hope that this experience happens to be useful for other
people, so that they can benefit from it. Rebuilding packages with
a package cacher is much more pleasant, especially if the package
has a lot of build-dependencies.</p>
