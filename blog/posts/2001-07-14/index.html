<p>Oh, what a day! I was <em>so</em> tired that I woke up at (almost) 5pm.
And, surprise: no light. Yes, a power outage. Anyway, my parents
weren't at home and I found a note that mom left on my computer's
keyboard telling me that they were shopping around. Then, I
discovered two new boxes at home: a brand new TV set and a new VCR.
The first time in 5 or 6 months that would be able to see my
amazing tape of <a href="http://www.opeth.com">Opeth</a> playing at Milwaukee
Metalfest. Woohoo.</p>

<p>But without power, my main concern was to be able to <em>see</em> anything
before the day became too dark. After half an hour (or was it an
hour?) trying to find some candles and fire, my parents arrived and
two hours later, I was watching "As Good As It Gets". Cool movie,
BTW. Excellent acting of both Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson (mom
told me that I act like him most of the time -- is that
compliment?).</p>
