<p>Even though I am late with this post, it is nice to say that I am writing
here from this year's DebConf10, in NYC.</p>

<p>Today (well, yesterday) was the day of the Cheese and Wine party and I think
that it was cool, at least for the moments that I were there. This post,
though, isn't technical in any sense. I only talks shortly about my
impressions of the community, as this is my first DebConf ever (despite the
fact that I have been using Debian since the late nineties).</p>

<p>I was very pleased to have met Bdale Garbee. I saw him the other day
arriving with Keith Packard, but I just didn't want to disturb them at that
point. We only talked for, say, 2 minutes, and his was one of the nicest
receptions that I had here.</p>

<p>And there were some other people that were equally easy to approach, nice to
talk with and, to my surprise, knew my name after some brief moments (yes,
this <em>does</em> make a difference, especially when you are in a strange country,
when you don't know anybody with whom you have worked for some years). Being
involved in the organization stuff, one would think that Jimmy Kaplowitz
would be so busy, but he was so kind.</p>

<p>I had longer conversations with Tássia Camões, Tiago Vaz (as always) and
some other people that I had not yet had the pleasure of meeting in
person. In particular, Daniel Baumann (who apparently is now crazy about our
FISL and wants to drink all Guaraná that he can get :-)), Chris Lamb and
Otávio Salvador and his mom. Those people are so cool and it is nice to
discuss some legal issues among different continents in the lounge of their
building at late night. <img src="../../smileys/smile.png" alt=":-)" /> Too bad that I am allocated to the other
building. <img src="../../smileys/smile.png" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>I <em>am</em> forgetting many other people (hey, it is 2 am here in NYC), but I
would feel guilty if I had not mentioned at least three people more: Martin
Michlmayr, Phil Hands, and Reinhard Tartler (who is uploading lame to the
debian repository, as the patents regarding it are expiring or expired
already).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>P.S.: I just created an account on flickr that I hope to populate with some
photos that I took here. And even with a nice squirrel. <img src="../../smileys/smile.png" alt=":-)" /></p>
