<p>I was quite surprised that I received
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~pf/algoritmos-livro/">a book</a> from a very,
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~pf/">very dear Professor</a> of mine. The book
is an introduction to the study of Analysis of Algorithms and it is
a pleasure to see a high-standard book (even if elementary) written
in Portuguese.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the translations of books like Cormen's
"Introduction to Algorithms" are severely broken. They are not
really worth the price and I would even dare to say that they do a
disservice to the student that tries to learn from those books
(Cormen's one in particular---be warned that I'm not talking here
about the original English edition, which is superb, but the
Brazilian Portuguese translation). There are many atrocities in the
translation like translating "array" to "arranjo", while the usual,
correct choices would be "vetor" or "matriz".</p>
