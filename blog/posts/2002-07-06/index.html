<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content">
<p>Took the day to see how things regarding the old PowerMac
9500/180MP were with a
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~branden/">newer XFree86</a>. Apparently,
<a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86 4.2</a> doesn't support the XVideo
extension for the imstt adapter, which is quite a pity.</p>

<p>What this means is that I am not able to use
<a href="http://xine.sf.net/">Xine</a> or <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">Mplayer</a>
to efficiently play videos on this computer.</p>

<p>I can see some things that make this computer slow:</p>

<ul>
<li>It has a modest amount of RAM for today's standards (64MB,
which is particularly little for PowerPC);</li>
<li>I don't know if it's RAM chips are in an interleaved
configuration or not;</li>
<li>If it had a faster/better supported video card (say, like a
<a href="http://www.ati.com/">ATI</a> Mach64), things would perhaps be better,
but this is just a guess. I don't know if the Mach64 sports XVideo
support under PowerPC, but perhaps the
<a href="http://gatos.sf.net/">Gatos</a> project might help here;</li>
<li>I have no idea why this computer, while having a SCSI interface
and drive, is so slow while it is using the disk. I see two things:
it freezes most things the user (that's me!) whenever it is writing
(reading?) anything to (from?) the disk and the transfer speeds are
quite sloooow. I wonder if this is a problem of the Linux SCSI
infra-structure, if it is a problem of the hardware or if it is a
problem of configuration. It probably isn't a problem with Linux,
since I also see the slowness with <a href="http://www.apple.com/">MacOS</a>
Classic (8).</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, just for fun, I tried to install
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">MacOS X 10.1</a> on this old computer.
The catch is that MacOS X can't be installed on anything this old.
Well, at least, that's what Apple says. I had to grab a copy of
MacOS 9 (in German!) just to bootstrap the system. Then, using
<a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/OSXCenter/XPostFacto/">XPostFacto</a>, the
installation was quite smooth (and slow). But with one gotcha at
the first reboot: a kernel panic.</p>

<p>After that, I went to sleep.</p>
