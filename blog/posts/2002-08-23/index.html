<p>Tried to go to my university, to see a seminar or the Steiner
Problem in Graphs, without success (the traffic didn't let me
arrive). Came back home and decided that it would be nice to visit
my uncle's store. He was leaving early to catch the last hours of
this year's Comdex and I went with him (he gave me an pass).</p>

<p>Its always nice to see all those exposition stands "competing" to
see which one has got the prettiest models. And it was also nice to
see that flat panels are invading the market, but I wonder how much
time it will take before they are "purchaseable", especially for a
graduate student.</p>
