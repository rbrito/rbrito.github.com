<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content">
<p>Given that Chromium/Chrome is used more and more (as became apparent
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2010/09/msg00610.html">with the discussion of including it in Debian's squeeze</a>), I decided to
give it some tries, mainly Giuseppe Iuculano's <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/c/chromium-browser.html">version</a>. I occasionally
install Chromium from Fabien Tassin's <a href="https://launchpad.net/~chromium-daily/+archive/ppa">daily builds</a>.</p>

<p>And, to be honest, I have also contributed a good amount (about 400) of
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~rbrito/+karma">translated strings</a> to the Brazilian Portuguese part of Chromium. As a
matter of fact, I have even done some "activism" and <a href="https://launchpad.net/~savanabifulco">incentivated</a>
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~bifulcojunior">other</a> <a href="https://launchpad.net/~victor.westmann/+karma">people</a> to create their accounts on Launchpad and help with
the projects.</p>

<p>But I always come back to Iceweasel/Firefox, especially with Mike Hommey's
frequently updated <a href="http://mozilla.debian.net/">repository</a>.</p>

<p>What are my reasons for staying with Iceweasel, and not with Chromium?</p>

<ul>
<li>I can disable full zoom in Iceweasel (i.e., I only want to zoom the text,
not the images). According to Chromium's project BTS, it seems that this
will be a <code>WONTFIX</code> bug, despite many people asking for it (and it having
a lot of duplicates).</li>
<li>I can, in Iceweasel, set my preferred fonts without resorting to hacks on
the system level, like say, having to lie with fontconfig or other stuff.
And I really want Deja Vu Sans, not a serifed font.</li>
<li>In Iceweasel, a middle mouse click on "an inactive portion" of the page
makes me go to the URL that is the system clipboard, just like pasting
stuff in X, in general, works.  I guess that there may be some way to
enable this in Chromium, but, so far, I have not found it.</li>
<li>In Iceweasel, I have a way (without resorting to many extensions or
hackish solutions) to use the equivalent of Firefox's "View &gt; Page Style &gt;
No Style" (i.e., to ignore any CSS sheet that the document author may have
specified on the page).</li>
<li>In Iceweasel, my personal data is encrypted before being synced.</li>
<li>In Iceweasel, I can press <code>Ctrl+Q</code> and make the damn browser quit, instead
of me having to use the mouse/trackpad/pointing device. This is probably a
lack of my understanding on how to associate key bindings to Chromium, but
the problem still stands.</li>
<li>Similarly, when there is only one tab open, pressing <code>Ctrl+W</code> in Chromium
does not close the tab (say, presenting me a blank tab or the list of most
visited sites), nor it closes the application.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would be satisfied if any of the above were fixed or better documented,
but it seems that some of those are, at best, going to wait a long time.</p>
