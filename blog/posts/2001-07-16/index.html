<p>Busy day. Woke up as soon as possible to see
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~jose/">my advisor</a> and decide the furture
of my Master's degree. Then, at almost 4pm, had a ridicule lunch,
met my girlfriend and went to a shopping mall with her. While I was
there, I was attacked by the capitalist bug and had to buy me
something. I was looking for some <a href="http://www.ora.com">O'Reilly</a>
books, but they were way too expensive (I was expecting to get a
<a href="http://perl.ora.com">Perl</a> book or
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lpython/">Learning Python</a>, but
decided not to).</p>

<p>I talked to the salesman and asked if he had
<a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~damian/">Damian Conway's</a>
<a href="http://www.manning.com/Conway/">Object Oriented Perl</a>, but he told
me <em>"the printing was cancelled"</em>. I told him that
<a href="http://www.manning.com">Manning Publications</a> wasn't told about
that and got some garbage as a response that I didn't even make an
effort to save in any part of my brain.</p>

<p>Since I had the mission to buy myself something, I got me
<a href="http://www.blind-guardian.com">Blind Guardian</a>'s "Nightfall in
Middle Earth". Wonderful.</p>

<p>To finish my day, I went to my uncle's store and got another SCSI
HD for the Powermac, but it was also defective. But now I'm a lot
more confident that the problem isn't with the mac itself, but with
the HDs (the mac would boot with the HD attached and see it while
in MacOS 8, but trying to install it on the HD evidenced that the
head was hitting the platters -- tomorrow I'll be getting another
SCSI HD). Let me cross my fingers. If I actually install Linux on
it, I'll grab <a href="http://www.penguinppc.org/~benh/">BenH</a>'s 2.4.6
Linux and get "my" mac a fresh kernel.</p>

<p>Oh, NetBSD 1.5.1
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Releases/formal-1.5/NetBSD-1.5.1.html">is released</a>.
I still can't get ISO images, though.</p>
