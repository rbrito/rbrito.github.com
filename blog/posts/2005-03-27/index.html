<p>Happy Easter for those who celebrate it! And it's all about
chocolate eggs. I love that (even though I have been limiting my
consumption of chocolate to a manageable minimum).</p>

<p>And I should say (once more) that I hate preparing tests. But one
thing that I hate more than preparing tests is scoring them,
especially when students make some confusing solutions that
<em>partially</em> solve the problem, but takes you almost an hour to
notice that! And that's just for one question...</p>

<p>Downloading huge quantities of new material, thanks to
<a href="http://www.easytree.org/">easytree.org's torrents</a>. Many
<a href="http://www.opeth.com/">Opeth</a> and
<a href="http://www.porcupinetree.com/">Porcupine Tree</a> bootlegs, including
videos. Oh, and some old-school Metallica. I'm also seeding many
torrents (right now, five).</p>

<p>Well, since <a href="http://news.individual.net/">news.individual.net</a> is
going to be paid starting from April 1st, I was checking if my
damned <a href="http://www.uol.com.br/">ISP</a> provides news. That's not
because I don't want to pay news.individual.net, but rather because
I felt that I shouldn't be using an external news server, since I
am already paying for Internet access and, IMNSHO, Usenet is one of
the basic services that every provider has to provide.</p>

<p>Well, I am sincerely considering going to sign up with
<a href="http://www.terra.com.br/">their competitor</a>, which has a huge
amount of groups in their service, including those that I want to
read (i.e., <a href="news:comp.theory">comp.theory</a>,
<a href="news:comp.text.tex">comp.text.tex</a>, <a href="news:comp.emacs">comp.emacs</a>,
and <a href="news:sci.math">sci.math</a>).</p>
