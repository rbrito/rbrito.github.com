<p>I have always thought that having flexible deadlines in MOOCs is important,
despite not having used them too much. Until last night, that is.</p>

<p>The course in question is Stanford's <a href="https://statlearning.class.stanford.edu">Statistical Learning</a> and they
adopted a policy of letting the students complete all the assignments of the
10 week course until the last day of the course, in March 21. Then, they
graciously extended the deadline to April 4.</p>

<p>Were it not for such an extension, I would not have completed the course. I
sent them a message on the course forums this morning to thank them for
this, as this, in my experience, is not so common with MOOCs.</p>

<p>I reproduce below the message that I posted on the forums:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Subject: Thank you also for the EXTENSION of the deadlines</strong></p>
  
  <p>Dear professors and staff,</p>
  
  <p>I would like to thank you (of course) for the course, as many others have
  already. Despite not liking edX platform too much (preferring the UI of,
  say, Coursera), your course was an exception, interesting enough (and funny
  enough) that I sticked to it until the end.</p>
  
  <p>But I would like to bring attention here to a point that many may not have
  appreciated (or, perhaps, not expressed as clearly as I thought that it
  deserved), namely, the extension of the deadlines (and a uniform deadline
  for all homeworks).</p>
  
  <p>In particular, due to some unfortunate facts of my personal life, I could
  not work on the course at all in the past few weeks. In fact, I completed
  units 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the last 3 or 4 days and submitted my
  last quiz a few hours before today's midnight (at my local time, UTC-0300),
  and I still got a passing grade(!).</p>
  
  <p>Even with my desire to finish the course, this would not have been
  possible if you had not graciously allowed for the deadline extension. I am
  sure that I may not be alone here in appreciating this extension (even
  though I think that I may be many standard deviations from the mean, doing
  the homework and R programs of 7 weeks in only 4 days).</p>
  
  <p>Thank you so very much for everything (including this extension!),</p>
  
  <p>Rogério Brito.</p>
