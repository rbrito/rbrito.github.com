<p>The acoustic show of Pain of Salvation is really nice. I didn't
have enough time to watch it yet, but it is an amazing thing that
should be kept, as the performance is superb (I did look quickly at
some points of it and, of course, the expectations have been
met---we are, after all, talking about a band that has a unique
touch).</p>

<p>Oh, speaking about unique bands, I will be seeing Opeth playing
live here in Brazil. Yes. This day has arrived. I will see my
favourite band playing here. I guess that I have to get in touch
with Mikael and see if I can sneak in a camera, so that I can shot
and film the show. This will be amazing, to say the least.</p>
