<p>This is, essentially, a call for help, as I don't really know which program
is at a fault here.</p>

<p>Given that Emacs's upstream
<a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/176760">converted their repository from bzr to git</a>, all the commits in
mirror repositories became "invalid" in relation to the official repository.</p>

<p>What does this mean in practical terms, in my case? Well, bear with me while
I try to report my steps.</p>

<h1 id="noticingaregressionandreportingabug">Noticing a regression and reporting a bug</h1>

<p>There is a regression with Emacs 24.4 relative to 24.3, which I discovered
after Emacs 24.4 <a href="https://packages.qa.debian.org/e/emacs24/news/20141025T214023Z.html">became available in Debian's sid</a>.</p>

<p>The regression in particular is that Emacs 24.4 doesn't seem to respect my
Xresources, while 24.3 does (and this is 100% reproducible: I kept the
binary packages of version 24.3 of emacs24 and I can install and reinstall
things).</p>

<p>When I <a href="http://debbugs.gnu.org/18902">reported this to upstream</a>, I received a reply that it worked fine
with another person that was using XFCE with unstable.</p>

<h1 id="testingvariousdesktopenvironments">Testing various Desktop environments</h1>

<p>As I am using the <a href="http://mate-desktop.org/">MATE desktop environment</a>, I proceeded to test this
assertion by installing XFCE. Emacs 24.4 read my Xresources. I went ahead
and installed LXDE. It worked again.  I tried once more with GNOME 3, but
"regular" GNOME 3 just crashed. I tried with GNOME 3 Classic and Emacs 24.4
just worked again.</p>

<h1 id="goingdeepintotherabbitshole">Going deep into the rabbit's hole</h1>

<p>Then, I got more curious and I tried to see why things worked the way that
they did and given that there was a
<a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/">mirror of the Emacs repo on github</a>, I cloned it and started
to <code>git bisect</code> to find the first problematic commit (I have no idea if
<code>bzr</code> even offers something like <code>git</code>'s <code>bisect</code> and I wouldn't really know
how to do it as quickly as I do with <code>git</code>).</p>

<p>To cut short a long story, after many recompiles, many wasted hours, a lot
of wasted electrical energy, <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/commit/15e14b165dcbc6566a0459b0d5e66f89080f569e">I found a bad commit</a> and
<a href="http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=18902#14">reported it</a>.</p>

<p>I received no response after that.</p>

<h1 id="thenewrepoentersinaction">The new repo enters in action</h1>

<p>Of course, all my hard work bisecting things was completely invalidated
after the transition to the new repository went live.</p>

<p>To make things relevant again, I used the awesome powers of <code>git</code>,
restricting the changes of the newly cloned repository to the e-mail of the
committer in question (Chong Yidong) and, from there, I proceeded to another
painful process of git bisects.</p>

<p>And, sure enough, the <a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=aac2b673c3083ab612bcd57fbcd9d370078bd8da">first bad commit</a> was the same one that I
found with the previous tree.</p>

<p>Semi-blindly reverting this commit, and also semi-blindly resolving the
conflicts make Emacs's from master work again on my system, but I highly
suspect that (given the way that I did it), it would not really be
appropriate for upstream.</p>

<p>But given also that I failed to receive feedback after my original report, I
am not too confident that this bug can be solved soon (even if it doesn't
qualify for being fixed in Debian 8).</p>

<p>After all this, I don't really know what else to do. I even
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=770781">filed a bug report</a> (more like a request for help) to the Debian
MATE maintainers.</p>

<p>As a side note, I would have filed a bug to upstream MATE, but it is not
really clear what the proper procedure to report bugs to them is---they seem
to use github's issues system, but given that they have separate
repositories for each component of the project, and that I don't know
precisely what repository to report to (or even if it applies to MATE after
all), I am more or less paralyzed.</p>

<h2 id="asidenote">A side note</h2>

<p>I must say that the conversion was well done by Eric Raymond, because the
whole <code>.git</code> repository of the new repo is only about 200MB, with history
going back to 1985, while the other repository had about 800GB.</p>
