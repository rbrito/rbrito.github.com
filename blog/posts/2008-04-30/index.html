<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content">
<p>Upgraded my parent's computer from
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>'s Feisty (7.10) to Hardy (8.04).
Now, some of the things that I'm used to when using
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>'s sid are available on their
computer.</p>

<p>Oh, I can't avoid to use this opportunity to complain once more
about my <a href="http://www.flash.net.br/">ISP</a>. If I weren't doing the
upgrade <strong>really</strong> early in the morning, I wouldn't have success,
as I am (right now), without signal from them. These outages are
getting on my nerves.</p>

<p>In some math related news, I finally saw a proof of the intuitive
fact the determinant of a 2x2 matrix is the signed area of the
parallelogram with vectors given by the column vectors of the
matrix.</p>

<p>Also, my D-Link G122 (I think that that's the model) doesn't work
with the <code>rt2500usb</code> driver that ships with the distribution: I can
see that <code>iwconfig</code> lists <code>wlan0</code> as having wireless extensions, I
can set the device, it can see the access point, I can enter the
WEP key, but it doesn't seem to get a DHCP lease from the router.
<code>:-(</code></p>
