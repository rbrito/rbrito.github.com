<div id="content">
<p>Finally, the text that I have been writing for some time now was
submitted for the Qualifying Examination of my Master's Degree!
This is a landmark in my career and many doors may be open for me
now, with many more professional possibilities. It also means that
I'll soon be having to present my work.</p>

<p>So I have already downloaded the whole
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice suite</a> for Linux, which
enables me to make presentations compatible with Microsoft's
Powerpoint without ever touching Microsoft software. OpenOffice has
already reached the beta status and I think that now is the time to
give it a try.</p>

<p>Went to the shopping mall and later to the supermarket with my
sweet girlfriend and bought CDs that I found in the bargain bin for
only R$ 2.80 a piece. Got Paul Dianno's solo CD in the bunch.</p>
