<p>It's been a long time since I last updated my diary. Let's see if I
can get things up to date (and let me see if I can keep me
organized and productive).</p>

<p>Today, the day started quite a bit messy: my computer, for some
reason, didn't want to turn on. It was beeping with my monitor
telling me to check the signal cable. "Humm... Time to buy another
graphics card" (and just the thought of having to choose from among
one less manufacturer of video cards scared me). I checked my
mainboard manual and it confirmed that the beeps I heard were
indeed problems with my graphics card (it's obvious that I didn't
want to believe the unfortunate situation of buying another card).</p>

<p>Having to use my computer anyway, I just removed my card from its
slot, and installed it again. Luckily, things started working
again. Whew! That was close! Anyway, I'm now watching this card
closely. Very closely.</p>

<p>Learned how to set up cookies with CGI scripts. Found out about
<a href="http://www.recipesource.com/">an site with recipes (for cooking)</a>
while having my daily dose of
<a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot.org</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps due to lousy system administrators,
<a href="http://www.iname.com/">Iname</a>/<a href="http://www.mail.com/">Mail.com</a> is
not delivering my e-mails. AGAIN. Enough.</p>

<p>BTW, I have to finish a take home exam on Approximation
Algorithms.</p>
