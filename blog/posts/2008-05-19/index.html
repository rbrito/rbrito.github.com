<div id="content">
<p>Today was seminar day. I gave my talk about a brief introduction to
Algorithm Analysis and I covered topics: a simplified computer
architecture (with special attention to the role of the memory and
of the CPU), a simple program for computing squares of integers and
the concept of iteration, the accounting of steps of the program
(which results in a linear polynomial in the number of squares
printed), the fact that we can ignore constants when doing analysis
of algorithms and asymptotic notation (O, <code>\Omega</code>, <code>\Theta</code>, o,
<code>\omega</code>, <code>\sim</code>). Statement of the Prime Number Theorem in terms of
asymptotic notation. Comments regarding difficulties of factoring
integers, despite tests for primality being "easy".</p>

<p>It seems that I didn't scare people when talking such things, and
that they felt like they understood what I said, which is good,
since there are often conflicts between the language that Computer
Science people (mainly the "practical people") use and the language
that Mathematicians use. Since I am mostly in the middle, I think
that I can talk with both without problems (but this means that I
am not an specialist in anything, alas).</p>
