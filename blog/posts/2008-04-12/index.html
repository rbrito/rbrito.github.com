<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content">
<p>During he past few days, I have been writing (in
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, of course!) some (very)
elementary notes on Elementary Number Theory, after starting to
read the classic book "Introduction to Number Theory", by Hardy &amp;
Wright. The reasons for me taking such notes are threefold:</p>

<ul>
<li>To know how much I retained of the content of my studies and to
serve as a reference for future for facts that I will surely
forget.</li>
<li>To provide a text that has a language different from the book,
which, while quite good, uses old-fashioned terms (e.g., they use
consistently the word "aggregate" for the word "set").</li>
<li>To provide both some algorithmic aspects of Elementary Number
Theory that are usually not covered in similar texts (while there
is quite a lot of room for the computational side of things) and to
provide multiple proofs (where I know them) of theorems, which
serve to illuminate the understanding of facts and see connections
with other fields.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today I got a phone call from a <em>very</em> dear friend of mine. I
<a href="http://www.floresonline.com.br/">sent her flowers and chocolate</a>
as a birthday gift.</p>
