<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content">
<p>After a long time without updates, I'm now back to "work".
<a href="http://www.vai.com">Steve Vai</a> is making some concerts here in São
Paulo, but unfortunately, I didn't attend it (the tickets' prices
were a bit on the steep side) and as I've just bought myself a new
new computer (woohoo), I'm saving a bit of money.</p>

<p>My new machine is a virgin <a href="http://www.amd.com">AMD</a> Duron 600MHz,
with an <a href="http://www.asus.com">Asus</a> A7V motherboard (which, among
other things, includes an UDMA/100 controller, FSB frequency
controls and multiplier control), 128MB of SDRAM/PC133, a great
<a href="http://www.matrox.com">Matrox</a> G400 card (monohead) with 16MB of
SGRAM and a <a href="http://www.samsung.com">Samsung</a> HD of 40GB.</p>

<p>I'm actually quite excited and aside from some problems that I had
with a defective Matrox (that I've now returned), it's working
wonderfully. It's so good that it even runs
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> quite fast! I can't wait for
<a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> 2.0.1 to be released on Monday (Dec 4th)
so that I can try the latest incarnation of
<a href="http://www.konqueror.org">Konqueror</a>.</p>

<p>BTW, <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> 2.8 was released today and
I've already downloaded a copy and burned onto CD. I think that
I've made everything right to get a bootable CD, but the CD that
I've made is only able to boot in my new computer. Strange.</p>

<p>And speaking of BSD, I also have <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>
4.2-RELEASE downloaded and burned. In fact, I think that I'm
spending way too much time with this Internet thing (I downloaded
FreeBSD the very same day it was released -- that's Nov 21st).</p>
