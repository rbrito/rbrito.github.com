<div id="content">
<p>Woohoo! Got Debian's XFree86 4.0.1 packaged for potato. It's faster
with my Trident 3D Imàge 975 than XFree86 3.3.6, because it uses
more hardware acceleration (in fact, this was the main reason I
tried to find it).</p>

<p>Of course, it couldn't be a painless experience.</p>

<p>For configuration, dexter didn't work (it died reproducibly when I
was configuring it) and xf86cfg didn't work (I can't remember the
reason why it didn't work). So, I was "forced" to use X's internal
autoprobing. But then, my old, 2-button, serial mouse couldn't be
used with 3 button emulation. It took me a lot of time to figure
out how to do that (since the documentation -- both man pages and
extra documents -- don't mention it). After some painful hours,
I've discovered the magical line `Option "Emulate3Buttons"'. It
then worked.</p>

<p>But then, there were remaining problems: some dock WindowMaker
utilities were removed when I installed the new X (due to
dependendy problems). I had to recompile them. Then, rxvt was
strange. Recompile time again.</p>

<p>Now, everything seems fine. Another thing to throw on that "extras"
CD.</p>
