<div id="content">
<p>Happy New Millennium! So many things have happened since the last
time I've updated my diary and I guess that since I can't summarize
everything accurately, I'll just list what I think are the
remarkable facts:</p>

<p>I have now put my new computer (a <a href="http://www.amd.com">Duron</a>
600MHz with a lovely <a href="http://www.asus.com">Asus</a> A7V motherboard)
to actual use. Of course, I made a backup of my older computer, so
that I was prepared for worst (read on);
<a href="http://www.kernel.org">Linux 2.4.0</a> has finally been released and
it includes a lot of new goodies. While I think that it is still
not the right time to switch to the new version, it is indeed quite
tempting (but I'll resist that temptation, since I've read a lot of
people complaining of data corruption with the new IDE drivers when
used with VIA chipsets -- and my motherboard features, guess what,
a VIA chipset, of course).
At the time of this writing (Feb 4th), Linux 2.4.1 was already
released, with many minor fixes;
A <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/testing">new version</a> of the
Linux Distribution that I use,
<a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a> is now getting more and
more functionality. It is ready for the new Linux 2.4.0 kernel, but
still under development (read: prone to break). Oh, why can't new
software be stable? In the mean time, I'm using Debian's
<a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/potato">potato</a>.
One week after I have started to use my new computer, my 40GB
Samsung drive broke. Ouch. Fortunately, I had taken backups of
everything from my old computer and any new data that I had on my
new computer was still readable. So, now, I'm using a new 30GB
<a href="http://www.quantum.com">Quantum</a> drive and everything seems to be
working fine again. Nice.
I am now reading more and more things about my Mastership work. It
will be in a sub-area of computer science called
<a href="../compbio/index.html">Computational (Molecular) Biology</a>. In
particular, I'm studying now alignments of multiple sequences. The
theory is quite general and applies to alignments of sequences over
any alphabets, but the biological motivation is to study and
compare (sub)sequences of DNA and of proteins;
I must confess that while I was reading slowly in the beginning,
without much motivation, now I'm quite excited about the subject.
It has really grown on me and now I see how much I still have to
catch up to read bleading edge papers (it is also surprising that
this area of knowledge has evolved so much in so little time, but I
guess that this is natural whenever there are economic interests in
a given field). Now, I want to learn more!</p>
