<p>Seeing now that the situation regarding Free fonts is much better than in
the past, I have started packaging some that are of high enough quality so
that we can have it available on our systems (be it Debian or any of the
good derivatives).</p>

<p>In particular, I spent some time during the past few days <a href="https://launchpad.net/~rbrito/+archive/ppa/">packaging</a>
some that, I think, deserve to be mentioned:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.paratype.com/public/">ParaType Sans</a>: this typeface family consists of a set of proportional,
sans-serif fonts that supply a lot of Cyrillic glyphs.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: the intention of this font is that of supporting many of the
smaller ethnic and cultural aspects present in Russia. It was even funded
by the Russian Government: in particular, by the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Agency_on_Press_and_Mass_Communications">Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Why you should care</strong>: for those (like me) that use a Latin-based
alphabet, the fonts also have some nice attractives, like, besides the
usual 4 shape/weight combinations (regular, italic, bold, bold italic),
two other variants: PT Sans Narrow (with its respective bold) and PT Sans
Caption (also with bold).</p>

<p>On top of that, the fonts support ligatures (liga, dlig), fractions
(frac), ordinals (ordn), and glyph composition (ccmp), among <em>other</em>
OpenType features.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymouspro.html">Anonymous Pro</a>: this typeface family consists of a set of fixed-width
fonts with the usual 4 shape/weight combinations (regular, italic, bold,
bold italic).</p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Anonymous Pro was made with people that stare at a computer
screen, coding for long amounts of time, or people that use a terminal all
the time.  Apart from being scalable, it also features some pre-made
bitmap versions at some sizes (10, 11, 12, and 13), so that they should
look better than some automatically drawn font without proper
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting">TrueType hinting</a>.</p>

<p>My package still is not good enough, as I have not yet included explicit
support for the bitmapped sizes via some fontconfig configuration, but I
expect to fix those in two or three days.</p>

<p>(This should just be a matter of including something like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;edit name="embeddedbitmap" mode="assign"&gt;
    &lt;bool&gt;true&lt;/bool&gt;
&lt;/edit&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>in the configuration that I ship with the fonts).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html">Cardo</a>: this is produced by David Perry and it is a proportional,
serif, old-style typeface similar to some highly regarded fonts like
Bembo. It does not offer italic, or bold versions.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Cardo's target "audience" are scholars that need to type set
Medieval texts, it has <em>many</em> glyphs, support for many opentype features
and the author has told me that he may even provide some support for
typesetting Mathematics (and this <em>is</em> a very big deal, since typesetting
Mathematics is hard enough when you decide to change your typefaces).</p>

<p>It works quite well with Jonathan Kew's <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/xetex">XeTeX</a> and you should just try
it, especially if you are into serif fonts (like I am).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.droidfonts.com/droidfonts/">Droid</a>: this consists of three font families, with varying shapes and
weights, in sans-serif, sans-serif monospaced, and serif families.  It has
received a lot of press, due to it being sponsored by Google and made by
Ascender Corporation.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: the Droid fonts were made for Google's Android platform and
one of the main concerns was to be readable on devices with low resolution
(like computer screens). It has a very wide coverage of glyphs (as one
would expect from a font for phones) and have very high quality. A really
nice donation to the world.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://linuxlibertine.sf.net/">Linux Libertine</a>: this has to be one of the most beautiful fonts that
I have see in a while. It has the basic four combinations of a serif font</p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: to provide a beautiful, "organic" version of a typeface that
can substitute Times/Times New Roman. It works well both with "regular"
latex/pdflatex and with XeTeX (and, quite probably, with LuaTeX). It has
quite a lot of OpenType features:</p>

<pre><code>rbrito:~&#036; otfinfo -f /usr/share/fonts/truetype/linux-libertine/LinLibertine_Re.ttf | wc -l
25
rbrito:~&#036;
</code></pre>

<p>OK, I can't be impartial with this font. It is beautiful. It is a pity
that we are in a feature freeze and that a the new version
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/602845#10">won't probably be included in squeeze</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/evristika/">Heuristica ("Эвристика")</a>: since Adobe has <a href="http://tug.org/fonts/utopia/LICENSE-utopia.txt">donated</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_%28typeface%29">Utopia</a>
to the <a href="http://tug.org/">TeX Users's Group</a> under a Free Software license, it was only
a matter of time that people would tweak them and generate other versions.
Then comes Andrey Panov's Heuristica, a modified version of the four basic
typefaces that Adobe donated, in OpenType format (and, to boot, some
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/font-helpers/">nice scripts for fontforge</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Heuristica improves Utopia with the primary intent of adding
Cyrillic symbols by Andrey V. Panov. Andrey has also incorporated
Vietnamese glyphs made available by Hàn Thế Thành. Heuristica is a family
that features regular and italic shapes, with both being present also in
bold weight.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Well, that's it for now. Stay tuned for more to come.</p>
