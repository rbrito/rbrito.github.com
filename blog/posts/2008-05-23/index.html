<p>Gave a second talk to the group of "Error Correcting Codes". This
time, I carried my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S1MP3">S1MP3</a>
player/recorder and recorded the talk. The nice thing is that
<a href="http://lame.sf.net/">LAME</a> with libsndfile1 can read those files
directly, without any kind of conversion first, which automates
things quite a lot.</p>

<p>During the seminar, I talked about algorithm invariants, how to
discover them, how close to mathematical induction they are, gave
examples of some programs, described the bubble sort algorithm in
our native/high level language, talked about its stability, talked
about its invariant, talked about its time and space complexity,
remarked that the algorithm works on any totally ordered set and,
finally, to answer a question from the audience, talked about the
limited precision of "integers" that we use on computers and
multiprecision libraries used to hold values as large as we
please.</p>

<p>Today was also dad's birthday! Hippie!</p>
