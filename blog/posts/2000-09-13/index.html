<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content">
<p>The nice thing today is that I have slept for 14 hours. I needed
that. And I still need yet another dose of it.</p>

<p>It stinks to see that
<a href="http://www.ajato.com.br">broadbrand providers</a> don't know their
shit, when one asks them for it. When I asked them for some not so
standard technical details, the support got all confused (all of a
sudden the line becomes silent). Anyway, I could understand that
they don't provide me with a fixed IP (but what do they use? DHCP?
PPP-over-Ethernet?). I've sent them an e-mail. I know that I'll
receive a "canned" answer.</p>

<p>Reiserfs 3.5.25 is released and now I can upgrade my kernel to
2.2.17 with reiserfs and André's patch.</p>

<p>I've been listening to Vivaldi all day long today. Talking about
music, I want to order Agalloch's "Pale Folklore" from
<a href="http://www.theendrecords.com">The End Record</a>'s on-line form, but
it seems that their shopping cart doesn't get anything included
when i select the album (am I using it correctly?).</p>

<p>A new Gnapster is released and now I can connect to the main
<a href="http://www.napster.com/">Napster</a> server again. Woohoo.</p>
