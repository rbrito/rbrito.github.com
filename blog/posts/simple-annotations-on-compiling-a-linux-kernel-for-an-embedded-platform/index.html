<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content">
<p>Here are some facts distilled from my experience with preparing kernels to
some embedded platforms. In other words, this is some of the stuff that is
usually presumed to be known, but that you won't find compiled in many
places, unfortunately.</p>

<p>I am writing them here in the hope that they can be useful to other folks
trying to compile their kernel to embedded devices (and I would venture to
say that these "non-standard" platforms would become more popular in the
future).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>some machines don't have monitors, keyboards etc. They may only have
network connections (e.g., ethernet) and USB ports. In such cases, it
console" called a netconsole. It can be enabled with the options: is quite
handy to see how the machine is booting with a "virtual console" called a
netconsole. It can be enabled with the options:</p>

<pre><code>CONFIG_NETCONSOLE=y
CONFIG_NETPOLL=y
CONFIG_NET_POLL_CONTROLLER=y
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>You have to tell the kernel where to send the messages that would,
otherwise, be presented on a screen. For sending them over the network, just
tell the kernel to use the command line option:</p>

<pre><code>    netconsole=6666@192.168.11.150/,@192.168.11.149/
</code></pre>

<p>This way, you can easily connect from another (more comfortable?) computer
with something like (this connection is made via UDP, not TCP):</p>

<pre><code>    ip addr add 192.168.11.149/24 broadcast 192.168.11.255 dev eth0
    nc -u -n -p 6666 192.168.11.150 6666
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>while some popular bootloaders for desktops are LILO and GRUB, many other
platforms use other bootloaders: yaboot, quik, bootx, silo, refit, etc. In
the case of embedded platforms, one that is popular is "das uBoot", which
needs a special kind of kernel image, a <code>uImage</code>, instead of a regular
<code>{b}zImage/vmlinu{x,z}</code> image. (Well, actually, some other arches need
images in other formats, like <code>vmlinux.coff</code> etc). Fortunately, the
kernel's makefile knows about some such arches and it generates the
correct image---but it is the task of the packager/distributor to find if
those images are needed or not. For the KuroBox HD/HG, all that is needed
is a simple:</p>

<pre><code>cp &#036;LINUXPATH/arch/powerpc/boot/uImage &#036;BUILT_ROOT/boot/uImage-&#036;VERSION
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>some extra care is needed when generating a kernel for such arches: the
tree of the devices which the kernel needs does not seem to be built
automatically (this is the case of the the KuroBox HD/HG). Something like
this is needed after the compilation of the kernel proper:</p>

<pre><code>./scripts/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb -V 16 -o &#036;BUILT_ROOT/boot/kuroboxHD.dtb-&#036;VERSION ./arch/powerpc/boot/dts/kuroboxHD.dts
./scripts/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb -V 16 -o &#036;BUILT_ROOT/boot/kuroboxHG.dtb-&#036;VERSION ./arch/powerpc/boot/dts/kuroboxHG.dts
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>to cross compile a kernel, don't forget to set the appropriate environment
options, like:</p>

<pre><code>INSTALL_MOD_PATH=&#036;BUILT_ROOT ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu- make clean
INSTALL_MOD_PATH=&#036;BUILT_ROOT ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu- make oldconfig
INSTALL_MOD_PATH=&#036;BUILT_ROOT ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu- make menuconfig
INSTALL_MOD_PATH=&#036;BUILT_ROOT ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu- make all modules
INSTALL_MOD_PATH=&#036;BUILT_ROOT ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu- make modules_install
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>It won't hurt if you use a concurrency setting (like -j3 or more) when
compiling all and modules.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The uBoot command line (accessed via the network) can be something like:</p>

<pre><code>ext2load ide &#036;{hdpart} &#036;{ldaddr} &#036;{hdfile}
ext2load ide &#036;{hdpart} 7f0000 boot/kuroboxHD.dtb
setenv bootargs root=/dev/sda1 netconsole=6666@192.168.11.150/,@192.168.11.149/
bootm &#036;{ldaddr} - 7f0000
</code></pre>

<p>The first two lines tell uBoot to load the both the kernel and the device
tree from the disk to the memory, the third line sets the kernel command
line (familiar to users of the "common" arches) and the fourth line
actually boots the kernel once it is loaded in the memory. Here, ${hdpart}
is the partition where the kernel image ${hdfile} should be loaded from
(usually in the form 0:1, to mean partition 1 from the disk 0), ${ldaddr}
is the memory address where the kernel should be loaded to.</p></li>
<li><p>Something that is handy, no matter what size your machine has: the use of
ext4 (and, in particular, delayed allocation) with ext{2,3}
filesystems. To use it, just put this in your kernel configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>CONFIG_EXT4_USE_FOR_EXT23=y
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Support for daemons like avr-evtd, that need access to a serial port (so
that the user can turn off the device by pressing the power button),
enable:</p>

<pre><code>CONFIG_SERIO=y
CONFIG_SERIO_SERPORT=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250=y
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, you will always have to ssh into the system, become root, and
issue something like:</p>

<pre><code>shutdown -h now
</code></pre>

<p>which is an inconvenience.</p></li>
<li><p>It is very important to set the Real Time Clock options right and this may
not be that obvious for some non-x86 platforms. In particular, for a
KuroBox HD, I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>CONFIG_RTC_CLASS=y
CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS=y
CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE=rtc0
CONFIG_RTC_INTF_SYSFS=y
CONFIG_RTC_INTF_PROC=y
CONFIG_RTC_INTF_DEV=y
CONFIG_RTC_DRV_RS5C372=y
</code></pre>

<p>The last option is, perhaps, the tricky one, and varies from system to
system. Knowing which one to enable is a matter of knowing the specs of
your system and, if not known, discovery by trial-and-error. (For x86
systems, usually <code>CONFIG_RTC_DRV_CMOS=y</code> is sufficient).</p></li>
</ul>
