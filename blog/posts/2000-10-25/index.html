<p>Tomorrow I'll have the "midterm" of Combinatorial Optimization.
It's not exactly a midterm, since it is considerably skewed towards
the end of the semester and I'll have 3 other tests until the
course is finished, but I guess that having this many tests is
actually better than having only two.</p>

<p>I'm terribly tired, sad (I'm not emotionally very well) and without
much motivation to study for my test. I have a reasonbly good grasp
of the theory, but some details of the subject didn't "sink in" up
till now and I'm not very much optimistic regarding what I can do
until tomorrow. In particular, finding negative cycles efficiently
(i.e., in polynomial time) is still a mystery for me. I have some
intuition of why the O(nm) algorithm works, but I have still to sit
down and write a complete, detailed a proof. I wish I had time.</p>
