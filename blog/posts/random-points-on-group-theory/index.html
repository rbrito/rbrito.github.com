<section id="content">
<p>It is not a surprise for anyone that I'm reviewing a little bit of Abstract
Algebra.</p>

<p>Reading Fraleigh's book is proving to be quite a good refresher, especially
since my short-term goal is to study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding%20Theory">Coding Theory</a> and the
finer aspects of Coding Theory do involve Algebra (actually, one could say
that the finer aspects of Coding Theory, especially Error Correcting Codes,
depend quite a lot on Algebra).</p>

<p>Well, while studying Group Theory, one can't avoid to be amazed by some
results that are not exactly that intuitive. For instance, I just discovered
that the additive group $\mathbb Z[X]$ of univariate polynomials with
integer coefficients is isomorphic to the multiplicative group $\mathbb Q^+$
of positive rationals.</p>

<p>I thought that this was a relatively easy exercise until I posed the problem
to a very competent friend of mine and he had some problems trying to come
up with the isomorphism. His failure maybe tells me that this is not as
obvious as I once thought and I think that this exercise should be better
known, as it can show that very differently looking algebraic structures can
be "the same" and the most surprising fact here is that <em>we are <strong>not</strong>
dealing with any pathologically "made up" example</em>!</p>

<p>Another thing that maybe is hard for students to grasp is the concept of a
factor group. Knowing that a subgroup is normal iff it is the kernel of some
homomorphism of groups is a handy way to memorize and "see" what a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/normal%20subgroup">normal subgroup</a> is. And students should be shown that there
are some quite special ("natural"?) normal subgroups of a group: the <em>center
of the group</em> and the <em>commutator subgroup</em>, just as two examples.</p>

<p>The latter one, together with a good explanation of what does it mean for
taking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient%20group">factor groups</a> (i.e., taking the
elements of the normal subgroup and equating them to the unity), leads to a
better understanding of quotient/factor groups. A nice thing to prove (that
is short and shows the "mechanics" of factor groups) is the fact that a
quotient group is abelian iff the normal group used as the "denominator"
contains the commutator subgroup.</p>

<p>Another thing that is worth doing is proving that a normal subgroup $N$ is
maximal in a group $G$ iff $G/N$ is simple. The proof of this fact is
analogous to the proof of the quotient of a ring being a field iff a ring is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor%20ring">factored</a> by a maximal ideal (and that we
get an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/integral%20domain">integral domain</a> if the ideal is only prime instead of
maximal).</p>

<p>Last, two groups that I feel that should merit way more attention than what
I perceive as being given in a first course are the dihedral groups $D_3$
and $D_4$. Asking the students to draw the lattice of subgroups of such
groups is quite enlightening, as they are "natural" groups that are not
abelian (but with <em>all</em> the proper subgroups being abelian). Nice examples
to have in mind, without any shadow of doubt.</p>
