<div id="content">
<p>Didn't sleep too much today (2nd day in a row!), since I was
watching one of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Theater">Dream Theater</a>'s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Theater#Bootleg_culture">official bootlegs</a>,
"When Dream and Day Reunite". (It was <em>cold!</em> in the morning).</p>

<p>But this was after I spent a very good amount of time
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>-packaging the upstream source code
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAME">LAME</a> (to which I have
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">CVS</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(data_management)">commit access</a>).
It now passes almost every
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lintian">lintian</a> check, besides the
fact that the <code>config.sub</code> and <code>config.guess</code> scripts have
time-stamps in the year of 2003. But I am not changing that (yet).</p>

<p>Now I am using my own dog-food, instead of relying on Christian
Marillat's precompiled versions of lame. And I even provided some
compatibility/transitional packages, so that packages like his
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ffmpeg">ffmpeg</a> with newer and nicest
improvements of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAME">LAME</a> (like
fractional
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_bitrate">variable bitrate</a>
qualities).</p>

<p>This means, in particular, that I can use better
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">MP3</a> sounding tracks for
videos.</p>

<p>And the good news is that, according to
<a href="http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/">Hydrogenaudio</a>, there is finally a
release of the lossy (but almost non-lossy!) compressor for audio
streams, called
<a href="http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=LossyWAV">lossyWAV</a>.
It surely seems quite promising.</p>

<p>Oh, and I finally discovered that the last show to which I went was
a looong time ago:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters_of_Rock#1998_3">Monsters of Rock Festival, September 24 1998</a>.
I was there to see Dream Theater, Megadeth, and Slayer, but some of
the people that were with me didn't like Slayer, unfortunately and
they wanted to exit the venue after I negotiated that I was there
to listen to, at least, "Raining Blood". Oh, Manowar was a joke.
Hilarious. I don't know if they take themselves seriously or not,
but they were ridiculous. This was the first time where I thought
of writing a program with a stochastic grammar to generate lyrics
for such stereotyped metal.</p>
