<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content">
<p>It's been quite a while since I last updated my diary. Many things
preventing me from updating it, which is good (well, at least part
of the things are good).</p>

<p>Been working towards finishing my M.Sc. degree. It seems that the
end never comes!</p>

<p>I've also been using <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">MacOS X</a>
(Jaguar) a lot lately. In some ways, it is a nice operating system.
But the lack of a real package management system is a bad thing. I
think that I've been spoiled by <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>'s
incredible (and clean) service. Unfortunately,
<a href="http://fink.sf.net/">Fink</a> isn't as good as Debian. And there are
quite few programs in binary form from Fink. And they don't have a
menu system like Debian's <code>menu</code>. And they don't even have
<a href="http://www.windowmaker.org/">Windowmaker</a> available! And AUCTeX.
etc</p>

<p>Saw that <a href="http://www.limewire.com/">Limewire</a> is uploaded to
Debian's incoming repository, which is cool. Also discovered this
<a href="http://muttprint.sf.net/">muttprint</a> package, which sounds
promising. Packaged for Debian also, of course.</p>
