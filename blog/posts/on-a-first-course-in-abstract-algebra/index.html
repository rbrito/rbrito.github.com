<section id="content">
<p>I've been thinking about how one should teach <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra">Abstract Algebra</a>
and it seems to me that John B. Fraleigh's book "A First Course in Abstract
Algebra" is exactly what I would write if I confidently knew the subject and
if the book were not written yet.</p>

<p>Of course, <strong>there is</strong> room for improvement (and I think that I may have
alternative proofs; in fact, I'm fond of multiple different proofs for a
given fact, as they shed a different light on the matter being discussed)
and I would change some demonstrations or condense some of them, but the
general outline of the book is superb.</p>

<p>I think that the choice (and order) of subjects is quite adequate, contrary
to many people that think that students should be exposed to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28mathematics%29">Rings</a> before
being exposed to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_%28mathematics%29">Groups</a>.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I think that, to foster the abstract thinking of students
that may not yet have the so-called "mathematical maturity", one should give
them "poor" algebraic structures (satisfying just a few axioms) and then
deducing things almost "mechanically". This "mechanic thinking" and "dealing
with the unknown" is quite important to dissociate the meaning that students
are used to assign to objects that they already know.</p>

<p>For instance, what is the "fun" (or even the motivation) of proving that 1
is greater than 0 on the integers? The students, quite correctly, assert
that this is "obviously true", for they can "draw", say, a ball on a sheet
of paper and no ball on another an say that <em>indeed</em>, given their
intuitive knowledge of what an order relation is, that there is no need to
prove anything!</p>

<p>Only when presented with structures where this is not true is that one would
appreciate the fact that there exists an example of an infinite integral
domain (with unique factorization, which is also not to take for granted!)
is that the proof of such a fact is perceived to be important.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if "everything is normal", one could think that "intuitive" facts
are indeed true and even disregard the necessity of proofs.</p>

<p>Beginning an abstract algebra book for freshmen or sophomores that had only
"computational" courses on Calculus up to that point (what an unfortunate
fact!) with a discussion of groups and spending a good amount of time with
proofs on elementary facts, leads the students to develop the frequently
cited prerequisite "mathematical maturity" needed for understanding anything
non-trivial that needs a good amount of abstraction (and this includes the
<strong>proper</strong> programming of computers, of course).</p>

<p>This should not be interpreted as an attack on texts that cover rings before
groups (or weaker structures). It just means that I think that, as a
pedagogical tool, using rings first may not be as "eye-opening" (for the
abstract world, and, therefore, for <em>Real Mathematics</em>) as other
approaches.</p>

<p>It is completely understadable for a graduate (or even advanced
undergraduate) text to provide a "fresh" view on Rings (and the pathological
cases <em>should</em> be included), say, by giving, as motivation, the problem
of writing primes as sums of two squares (which can be viewed as a problem
of factorization on the Gaussian Integers integral domain).</p>

<p>I hope that other instructors actually read this and stop to think about the
possibilities, even if they don't agree with my views (just causing thought
is enough for me).</p>
