<p>I have been having quite costly experiments with <a href="http://buffalo.nas-central.org/wiki/LS_Hardware_and_Software_information">(embeded) hardware</a> in
the last few weeks/months. To cover at least part of the expenses, I am
trying out to use Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense">AdSense</a> with my blog.</p>

<p>I plan on blogging more frequently with the results of the experiments, but
it will take me a few days, as I want to offer people only the "meat" of
what I actually did, pointing out some pitfalls that made me waste a lot of
time.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to AdSense, one interesting thing about trying it is that I
applied to be part of the program for 3 or 4 times late in August and, due
to unspecified reasons, my application was rejected for "not complying with
their policies".  I read the policies from left to side, from up and down
and nowhere I saw anything that my blog infringed.</p>

<p>This morning, I tried once again and I'm now in a sort of "probation period"
for AdSense, which is progress I think.</p>

<p>So far, I only put one advertisement at the top of my pages, but I am
curious to know how "targeted" those ads would be to a blog that has
articles that were written more than a decade ago, with posts in at least
two languages.</p>

<p>I guess that this is a weaker version of what <a href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/">Raphaël Hertzog</a> is trying
to do with his funding campaigns, except that I only expect to cover the
costs of my hardware (even if I am skeptical that I will actually manage to
reach that point of self-sufficiency).</p>
