<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content">
<p>In a burst of nostalgia, I decided to see what the
<a href="http://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> had to say about my
first web presence. Unfortunately, due to the fact that my account
was mistakenly deleted by our former system administrator and then
recovered again, it didn't show me my first page.</p>

<p>But, on the bright side of things, I actually found pages of
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970803122922/www.ime.usp.br/~lymber/">two</a>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010428082758/www.ime.usp.br/~malmeida/">friends</a>
dating back from when homepages weren't that common: at about
1995/1996. Almost a decade ago!</p>

<p>And, in the very same fashion, I tried to find my first usenet
posts, that are stored now at
<a href="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</a>. The earliest post that
I could find was dated
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/byx6a">21st of December of 1994</a> (now more than
a decade ago), but I am sure that there were posts of mine that
preceded that.</p>
