<div id="content">
<p>Went to my University to go to the library and there was a seminar
there. I stayed after being kindly asked by the professor that
coordinates the seminar. <code>:-)</code></p>

<p>After that, I decided that it would be nice to go to the library to
visit once more the section of Number Theory. I was aware that
Diophantine equations were important. But I just didn't know that
elliptic curves are Diophantine equations. And the subject is
dense.</p>

<p>By the way, talking about Number Theory, I'm starting to feel the
need of studying some Mathematical Analysis: the whole area of
Analytic Number Theory is alien to me and it shouldn't be (for a
person that aims at knowing the basics of Number Theory). Actually,
I can't even recall some basic facts from my calculus courses. I
think that it is high time for a refresher.</p>
