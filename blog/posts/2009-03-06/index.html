<section id="content">
<p>My girlfriend had some complications in her biopsy and I had to
play the nurse role. Deinfecting the place and going with her to
the medical service was the next step. Actually, she went to a
vascular physician and to a general physician.</p>

<p>After she was medicated, we went to the bank and I was there to
learn some things about the private social security system of
Brazil, with two plans: VGBL and PGBL. They seem like a reasonable
thing to use, but I fear that I will need the money in less time
than what was told me that I have to keep it there for not having
to pay a huge amount of taxes.</p>

<p>Oh, talking about taxes, I installed the Brazilian tax program,
written in Java, since I don't have Windows. Surprisingly, it
doesn't play well with openjdk-6-jre, which is quite amusing.
Falling back to the non-free jre 5.0 did the job, but this makes me
think that SERPRO (I think that this is the department responsible
for writing the programs) didn't really grasp the meaning of
"portability": they are only delivering binaries for Linux x86. No
amd64, powerpc and other architectures. What a shame.</p>
