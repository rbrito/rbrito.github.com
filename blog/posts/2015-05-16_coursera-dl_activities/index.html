<p>Lately, I have been dedicating a lot of my time (well, at least compared to
what I used to) to Free Software projects. In particular, I have spent a
moderate amount of time with two projects written in Python.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to talk about the first, more popular project is called
<a href="https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera">coursera-dl</a>.  To be honest, I think that I may have
devoted much more time to it than to any other project in particular.</p>

<p>With it I started to learn (besides the practices that I already used in
Debian), how to program in Python, how to use unit tests (I started with
Python's built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html"><code>unittest</code></a> framework, then progressed to
<a href="https://nose.readthedocs.org/">nose</a>, and I am now using <a href="http://pytest.org/">pytest</a>),
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/coursera-dl/coursera">hooking up the results of the tests</a> with a continuous
integration system (in this case, <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>).</p>

<p>I must say that I am sold on this idea of testing software (after being a
skeptical for way too long) and I can say that I find hacking on other
projects without proper testing a bit uncomfortable, since I don't know if I
am breaking unrelated parts of the project.</p>

<p>My use/migration to pytest was the result of a campaign from <code>pytest.org</code>
called <a href="http://pytest.org/latest/adopt.html">Adopt Pytest Month</a> which a kind user of the project
<a href="https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera/issues/317">let me know about</a>.  I got a
<a href="https://meejah.ca/">very skilled volunteer</a> assigned from pytest to our project.
Besides learning from their pull requests, one side-effect of this whole
story was that I spent a moderate amount of hours trying to understand how
properly package and distribute things on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a>.</p>

<p>One tip learned along the way: contrary to the official documentation, use
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine">twine</a>, <em>not</em> <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/packageindex.html#the-upload-command"><code>python setup.py upload</code></a>. It is more
flexible for uploading your package to PyPI.</p>

<p>You can see <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coursera">the package on PyPI</a>.  Anyway, I made the
first upload of the package to PyPI on the 1st of May and it already has
almost 1500 downloads, which is far more than what I expected.</p>

<p>A word of warning: there are other similarly named projects, but they don't
seem to have as much following as we have. A speculation from my side is
that this may be, perhaps, due to me spending <em>a lot</em> of time interacting
with users in the bug tracker that github provides.</p>

<p>Anyway, installation of the program is now as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>pip install coursera
</code></pre>

<p>And all the dependencies will be neatly pulled in, without having to mess
with multi-step procedures. This is a big win for the users.</p>

<p>Also, I even had an <a href="https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera/pull/288#issuecomment-69610097">offer to package the program</a> to
have it available in Debian!</p>

<p>Well, despite all the time that this project demanded, I think that I have
only good things to say, especially to the original author, <a href="https://twitter.com/jplehmann">John Lehmann</a>. <img src="../../smileys/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>If you like the project, <a href="https://twitter.com/rtdbrito">please let me know</a> and consider
yourselves invited to participate <a href="https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera#fork-destination-box">lending a hand</a>, testing/using the
program or <a href="https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera/issues">triaging some bugs</a>.</p>
