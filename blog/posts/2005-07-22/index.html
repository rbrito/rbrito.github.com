<p>Mom's birthday. And a nice opportunity to see some relatives here.
Quite nice to have all them together. And it wasn't free of
surprising things. Something that once would be attached to geeks
was actually the subject of conversations for a moment: the use of
Internet.</p>

<p>In some sense, I feel that being the pioneer of the family to have
used Internet was interesting. But, then, motivated by the recent
surgery that I "survived", made me see things in a quite different
fashion: using the Internet and computers like there's no tomorrow
is a pure waste of time.</p>

<p>I think that the Internet is slowly turning into the new TV. There
are obvious differences, because you are in command of (some)
things, but, to be honest, I am not exactly sure that people are
that much in control as they think that they are.</p>

<p>In other news, I have started playing with Java's multithreaded
abilities. A nice way to play with them, but the book that I have
here requires a lot of patience on my part: it is a translation of
"The Java Programming Language", 1st edition. The catch is that the
stupid person that tranlated it also translated <em>commands</em> of the
language and names of classes! Is this a contest of foolness or
what?</p>
