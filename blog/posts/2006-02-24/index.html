<div id="content">
<p>Still trying to learn about digital photography. The subject is
fascinating. Too bad that I lack subjects to take pictures from,
but I guess that this is where the "artistic" part comes in.</p>

<p>Of course, the is also the "science" part of the thing, which is
where the knowledge comes in: choosing exposure, knowing what
lenses you should (or should not) use, seeing the appropriate flash
light settings etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many things are written in market-speak and it is
almost impenetrable for a layman to know exactly what is being
talked about.</p>

<p>I upgraded
<a href="ftp://ftp.matrox.com/pub/mga/archive/bios/2005/setup_258.exe">the firmware</a>
of my <a href="http://www.matrox.com/">Matrox</a>
<a href="http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/user_manuals/mill_g400/home.cfm">G400</a>
card to version 2.1.</p>

<p>Oh, I didn't know why my students were all excited to go home until
I realized that today was the first day of 2006's carnival.</p>
