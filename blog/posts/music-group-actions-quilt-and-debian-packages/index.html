<section id="content">
<p>These are some short notes on what I've doing these days.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there isn't much to talk about. I think that one of the most
relevant things that I did was to resurrect one of my best
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital%5Faudio%5Fextraction">audio-extracting</a> CD-ROM
drives: just opened the case of my computer, took off the CD drive, opened,
cleaned its lens, lubricated the moving parts and everything is back to
normal operation.</p>

<p>This sense of "getting something for nothing" is hard to explain to those
who have not experienced it already.</p>

<p>Other things that I did was to grab some old CDs that I had laying here
(Radiohead's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK%20Computer">OK Computer</a>, Pantera's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far%5FBeyond%5FDriven">Far Beyond Driven</a>, the tribute to Queen called "Dragon
Attack", and Gentle Giant's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free%20Hand">Free Hand</a>, among others). Dream
Theater's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic%5FChaos">Special Edition of Systematic Chaos</a>
is quite good, but unfortunately I don't have a 5.1 system at my disposal.</p>

<p>I also selected some material for further studies. I'm right now studying
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/group%20actions">group actions</a> (or G-sets as some seem to prefer). Soon, I
will be finishing the basics of Group Theory (hey, really, why is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugacy%20class">Class Equation</a> of groups that
"famous"? It is just a matter of saying that \(|X| = \sum_{x\in X} 1\), but
with cardinality of orbits instead of with one's and with a transversal of
the orbits in place of \(X\) itself).</p>

<p>Actually, if the orbits of the elements of the \(G\)-set \(X\) consist of just
one element, then the equation above is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group%20action">Class Equation</a> (what some people would
call \(\mathop{\mathrm{Fix}}(X)\), I would call the "orbits being trivial").</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s%20lemma">Burnside's lemma</a> (which actually seems to be wrongly
attributed, since it seems to be discovered independently by Cauchy and
Frobenius) for counting orbits of a given action of a \(G\)-set has nice
implications in combinatorics and it should be, at least, mentioned in any
self-respecting introduction to Group Theory.</p>

<p>Oh, I almost forgot one of the major things that I did today (2007-06-12): I
finally learned how to manipulate the <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt"><code>quilt</code></a> patch-system (initiated
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew%20Morton%20%28computer%20programmer%29">Andrew Morton</a>).
The crucial point that is not written anywhere: the patches, by default, are
applied with <code>-p1</code> instead of <code>-p0</code>. This took me quite some time to get, as
the documentation isn't explicit about it. Installation of quilt in a
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">MacOS X</a> system is not trivial, due to the demand of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> tools.</p>

<p>But now I can keep some <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> packages of mine in a better shape than
if I were just applying a single monolithic patch.</p>
