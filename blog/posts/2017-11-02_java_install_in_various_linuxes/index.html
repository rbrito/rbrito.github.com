<section id="content">
<p>Today I spent some time in the morning seeing how one would install the JDK
on Linux distributions. This is to create a little comparative tutorial to
teach introductory Java.</p>

<p>Installing the JDK is, thanks to the OpenJDK developers in Debian and Ubuntu
(Matthias Klose and helpers), a very easy task. You simply type something
like:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
</code></pre>

<p>Since for a student it is better to have everything for experiments, I
install the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/openjdk-8-jdk">full version</a>, not only the
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/openjdk-8-jdk-headless"><code>-headless</code></a> version. Given my familiarity with
Debian/Ubuntu, I didn't have to think about the way of installing it, of
course.</p>

<p>But as this is a tutorial meant to be as general as I can, I tried also to
include instructions on how to install Java on other distributions. The
first two that came to my mind were <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">openSUSE</a> and <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a>.</p>

<p>Both use the RPM package format for their "native" packages (in the same
sense that Debian uses DEB packages for "native" packages). But they use
different higher-level tools to install such packages: Fedora uses a tool
called <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DNF"><code>dnf</code></a>, while openSUSE uses <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Zypper_usage"><code>zypper</code></a>.</p>

<p>To try these distributions, I got their netinstall ISOs and used
<code>qemu</code>/<code>kvm</code> to install on a virtual machine. I used the following to
install/run the virtual machines (the example below, is, of course, for openSUSE):</p>

<pre><code>qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -smp 2 -net nic,model=e1000 -net user -drive index=0,media=disk,cache=unsafe,file=suse.qcow2 -cdrom openSUSE-Leap-42.3-NET-x86_64.iso
</code></pre>

<p>The names of the packages also change from one distribution to another. On
Fedora, I had to use:</p>

<pre><code>dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
</code></pre>

<p>On openSUSE, I had to use:</p>

<pre><code>zypper install java-1_8_0-openjdk-devel
</code></pre>

<p>Note that one distribution uses dots in the names of the packages while the
other uses underscores.</p>

<p>One interesting thing that I noticed with <code>dnf</code> was that, when I used it, it
automatically refreshed the package lists from the network, something which
I forgot, and it was a pleasant surprise. I don't know about <code>zypper</code>, but I
guess that it probably had fresh indices when the installation finished.</p>

<p>Both installations were effortless after I knew the names of the packages to
install.</p>

<p>Oh, BTW, in my 5 minute exploration with these distributions, I noticed that
if you don't want the JDK, but only the JRE, then you omit the <code>-devel</code>
suffix.  It makes sense when you think about it, for consistency with other
packages, but Debian's conventions also make sense (JRE with <code>-jre</code> suffix,
JDK with <code>-jdk</code> suffix).</p>

<p>I failed miserably to use Fedora's prebaked, vanilla
<a href="https://alt.fedoraproject.org/cloud/">cloud image</a>, as I couldn't login on this image and I decided
to just install the whole OS on a fresh virtual machine.</p>

<p>I don't have instructions on how to install on <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Gentoo</a> nor on
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a>, though.</p>

<p>I now see how hard it is to cover instructions/provide software for as many
distributions as you wish, given the multitude of package managers,
conventions etc.</p>
