<section id="content">
<p>Today I finally got the Power Macintosh 9500/180MP with
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian testing</a> installed in a semi-decent
way: I'm using BenH's 2.4.17-ben0 kernel which finally has the mace
driver working again. What does this mean? Well, it means that I'm
now not confined to 2.2.x kernels anymore. A 2.4 kernel has many
advantages, especially, for the PowerPC platform. Among other
things, they are faster for the same hardware, have good SMP
support, the IMSTT pci card is recognized (which wasn't in the 2.2
kernels) and a lot of other nice goodies like a journalling
filesystem (ext3) etc.
Also got <a href="http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3/">lame 3.90.1</a> compiled for the
PowerPC in a decent way.</p>

<p>A collateral effect of having lame compiled for the ppc is that now
I have a have a good benchmark that shows me roughly how much
slower this thing is in relation to my Duron 600MHz. The sad news:
it is 5 or 6 times slower than the Duron. If lame were
multithreaded, then it could be up to 2.5 times slower, which would
be acceptable for day-to-day use.</p>

<p>As a side note, got some work done to make the Debian packaging
scripts a bit nicer (read: closer to being lintian clean).
Unfortunately, lintian still complains about the shared library
package having an rpath and I don't know how to get rid of that
(not even a kludgy solution).</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://mplayer.sf.net">MPlayer</a> released another version
(0.60pre2), I downloaded the sources and, to my surprise, it
compiles on PPC (the 0.60pre1 didn't). And it even plays, errr,
tries to play DivX movies! Amazing job these guys are
accomplishing.</p>

<p>After struggling a lot with the configuration files, also got X
4.1.0 working on a framebuffer device (the imstt driver doesn't
work). So, now I even have a reasonably fast, modest GUI working
(or a slower GUI if I load <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE 2</a>). And I can
even use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> here, although the
swapping doesn't make it a pleasant experience. In this respect,
<a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>, while non-free, is much better.</p>

<p>All in all, this can now be a poor's man desktop machine. If it
only consumed power proportional to its speed, it would be nicer.</p>
