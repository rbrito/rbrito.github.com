Re: First post from DebConf 10

</div>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>This was my first Debconf as well and I was glad to meet you at the event. Thank you for making me feel welcome in Debian even though I'm new here.</p>

<p>P.S. the updates to the package I am working on http://packages.debian.org/sid/xtrkcad were implemented, sponsored, and uploaded the day before the freeze.</p>

Re: A version of xpdf with the poppler backend available

</div>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>There are some reasons:</p>

<pre><code>it is lighter (and depends on fewer packages, and is better for those using it remotely etc)
it has the ability to zoom more, which both evince and epdfview don't; even if you patch them to use higher zoom levels, as they render the whole page at once, they will bring your computer to a halt
</code></pre>

I just learned about existence of epdfview which is using poppler.. so why should average user choose xpdf-poppler over epdfview?

Re: A version of xpdf with the poppler backend available

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>Oh, thanks for the report. Indeed, it was missing a comma there. It is fixed on the repository.</p>

<p>Regarding the floating point exception, could you please give me some details more? I can't reproduce it and I would love to fix this as soon as possible. Which architecture are you using? Which version of poppler? Right now, I am developing with an amd64 and with Debian's poppler 0.12.4-1.</p>

<p>If you could provide me with further details on http://github.com/rbrito/xpdf-poppler/issues I would be grateful to help.</p>

<p>A very kind Gentoo user also tested a version and confirmed that it is working on his system.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>a great project.. does it work currently?
I tried to build it on my laptop, there's a comma missing in xpdf.cc:65 and starting ends with a "Floating point exception".</p>

Way to go Sebastian, your little something will make youtube-dl mostly obsolete for me, since it now works fine in Epiphany!

<p>Hi, Sebastian.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, I know that this "something" is the gstreamer infrastructure. <img src="../smileys/smile.png" alt=":-)" /> Just excuse my lack of abilities with English. I was so excited to have understood how the videos could be found with youtube-dl and push the release as soon as possible that I didn't think very much about the phrasing.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's great and I am using gstreamer with a lot of programs (and I am enjoying the gst123 command line program that Ahmed El-Mahmoudy uploaded and just got accepted from the NEW queue).</p>

<p>Thanks for your job, BTW.</p>

<p>This "something" makes it possible to play or create WebM files in software that uses GStreamer. For example with epiphany-browser you'll be able to watch the WebM YouTube videos, transmageddon can create WebM files out of everything else, etc <img src="../smileys/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>(And of course GNOME's official media player totem can play the WebM files if gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad is installed)</p>
