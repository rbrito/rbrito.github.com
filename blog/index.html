</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>This post is just a bunch of random notes, but I think that things are going
well, this time.</p>

<h1 id="btrfs">Btrfs</h1>

<p>Just started playing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/btrfs">btrfs</a> after converting a 2TB disk
with about 1.3TB of data from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ext4">ext4</a> to btrfs.  This particular
filesystem contains my backup data and I hope that btrfs is able to live up
to high standards.</p>

<p>I will probably write a detailed review with my impressions, but suffice to
say that it is working fine and I hope that I will be happy for a long time
to come. My other filesystems, for the moment, will be ext4.</p>

<h1 id="courseradownloader">Coursera Downloader</h1>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/jplehmann">John Lehmann</a>'s generosity, now <code>coursera-dl</code> has a new home:
a <a href="https://github.com/coursera-dl">github organization</a> of its own!</p>

<h1 id="youtube-dl">youtube-dl</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/1612">Some people may have noticed, others may not</a>, but when downloading
videos from Youtube, they apparently are getting more aggressive with the
use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic%20Adaptive%20Streaming%20over%20HTTP">Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP</a> (also called
DASH) and, as a result, some (perhaps going to be all in the near future?)
of the videos may not be available in the resolution/formats that you used
to like (like me, with format number 35).</p>

<p>By the way, one thing that is interesting with youtube videos provided via
DASH is that they are available in different streams: one for the video and
another for the audio.</p>

<p>What does this mean in practical terms for users of youtube-dl?  Well, if
you wanted to download videos in resolutions like the 480p (format 35) that
I mentioned, then you will probably have to change your way of doing things,
until a more automated solution is in place.</p>

<p>You will have to download both the audio and the video and, then, "combine"
them (that is, multiplex them) to create one "normal" video file with both
the audio and the video. I usually do this via:</p>

<p><code>
ffmpeg -i audio.m4a -i video.mp4 -vcodec copy -acodec copy combined.mp4
</code></p>

<p>If you prefer having a Matroska container instead of an mp4 container
(which, BTW, results in <em>smaller</em> muxing overhead), then you can use the
command line:</p>

<p><code>
mkvmerge -o combined.mkv audio.m4a video.mp4
</code></p>

<p>Oh, those <code>m4a</code> and <code>mp4</code> extensions are a new addition that
<a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/pull/1622">I just sent upstream</a> (in the past, both would have been named with an
extension of <code>mp4</code>).</p>

<p>As, an aside, I like formats <code>135</code> for video and <code>140</code> for audio, for the
reasons that I mentioned in a comments to issue 1612:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Otherwise, to download 480p videos (which I do for lectures and so on with
  other projects of mine, like edx-dl) I have to call youtube-dl twice: once
  for format 135 and another for format 140, since the old <img src="./smileys/question.png" alt="(?)" /> format 35
  files are much smaller than the lower resolution 360p files (due to the
  former being encoded in High profile vs. the latter being encoded in
  Constrained Baseline profile).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this is unfortunate for some, this is a good thing for others: I once
had a blind user of <code>youtube-dl</code> asking me if he could avoid downloading the
whole video just to extract the audio, so that he save on bandwidth. Well,
now this is possible.</p>

<p>Expect a new version of <code>youtube-dl</code> to be uploaded soon to Debian unstable.</p>

<h1 id="music">Music</h1>

<p>It is so nice to see the music that I like getting better. It was
particularly pleasant to <a href="https://www.youtu.be/hAnVFJFmFx8">see</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarja%20Turunen">Tarja Turunen</a> being joined
on stage by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor%20Jansen">Floor Jansen</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, it is my impression that the once female-fronted bands are getting
more and more into collaborations and side-projects and they are, in many
ways, getting more refined. Examples of this includes Floor, Tarja,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anneke%20van%20Giersbergen">Anneke van Giersbergen</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon%20den%20Adel">Sharon den Adel</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari%20Ruesl%C3%A5tten">Kari Rueslåtten</a> and many others that I can't remember right
now.</p>

<p>Of course, some thanks to people that take the time to film, and
upload/share the videos so that other people not at these events can watch
them is highly appreciated and they usually are treated as anonymous, but,
of course, this should be fixed.</p>

<a href="./posts/2013-10-18-bittorrent_with_webseed/">Quick tip #1</a>

</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>I wrote the following as part of a post to an discussion forum (I can't
remember which one), and people told me that they liked this information and
said that others would profit from it if I posted it on my blog, which I now
decided to post.</p>

<p>The context: for homework of one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOOC">MOOC</a>, people were trying to
download a large virtual machine image that was offered both via an official
HTTP source, which was slow.</p>

<p>A person volunteered that already had downloaded the image volunteered to
create a bittorrent to help fellow students.</p>

<p>Other students started saying that the bittorrent download was faster up to
a certain point and, then, things slowed down a lot. Of course, they got
faster to the point where lots of pieces were already well distributed and,
then, only the everybody had already downloaded things and, then, only the
seeder had the missing segments of the torrent.</p>

<p>Then I commented with:</p>

<hr />

<p>Depending on your bittorrent client, you can add the original HTTP
download as a "Web seed" and, this way, your client will download <em>both</em>
from the peers and also from the web to fill in parts that are not yet
available.</p>

<p>One such client is the Free (as in Freedom) <a href="http://qbittorrent.sf.net/">qbittorrent</a>, but I guess that
others also have this option.</p>

<hr />

<p>Soon after that, people started downloading things much faster.</p>

<a href="./posts/sna_acceleration_vs_uxa/">SNA Acceleration vs. UXA Acceleration</a>

</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>Seeing as recent versions of Xorg have made it into Debian's testing (which
I am using right now, instead of my usual sid installations), I decided to
see what they would bring me in terms of performance, since they have the
SNA acceleration implemented as well as the standard UXA acceleration.</p>

<p>Well, I did not have any other tests to perform, but below are the results
on my wife's laptop (a Core i5 2410M), when running <a href="http://packages.debian.org/gtkperf">gtkperf</a>:</p>

<h1 id="withuxa">With UXA</h1>

<pre><code>GtkPerf 0.40 - Starting testing: Mon Aug 12 20:33:20 2013

GtkEntry - time:  0.19
GtkComboBox - time:  5.36
GtkComboBoxEntry - time:  3.59
GtkSpinButton - time:  0.60
GtkProgressBar - time:  0.41
GtkToggleButton - time:  0.73
GtkCheckButton - time:  0.48
GtkRadioButton - time:  0.97
GtkTextView - Add text - time: 21.72
GtkTextView - Scroll - time:  2.29
GtkDrawingArea - Lines - time:  6.18
GtkDrawingArea - Circles - time:  6.74
GtkDrawingArea - Text - time:  4.32
GtkDrawingArea - Pixbufs - time:  0.67
 --- 
Total time: 54.25
</code></pre>

<h1 id="withsna">With SNA</h1>

<pre><code>GtkPerf 0.40 - Starting testing: Mon Aug 12 20:36:58 2013

GtkEntry - time:  0.21
GtkComboBox - time:  4.86
GtkComboBoxEntry - time:  2.67
GtkSpinButton - time:  0.59
GtkProgressBar - time:  0.24
GtkToggleButton - time:  0.61
GtkCheckButton - time:  0.51
GtkRadioButton - time:  1.00
GtkTextView - Add text - time: 17.19
GtkTextView - Scroll - time:  1.84
GtkDrawingArea - Lines - time:  2.70
GtkDrawingArea - Circles - time:  2.65
GtkDrawingArea - Text - time:  1.72
GtkDrawingArea - Pixbufs - time:  0.11
 --- 
Total time: 36.91
</code></pre>

<p>So, with SNA, the timing that I get are almost 2 times lower, which is
superb for a very simple <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> config file:</p>

<pre><code>Section "Device"
        Identifier "Intel Graphics"
        Driver "intel"
        Option "AccelMethod" "sna"
EndSection
</code></pre>

<p>I have not noticed any change, but if drawing graphics faster means that I
get a bit more of battery life, then I will be super happy. I still have not
tested if this works on my notebook with a Core2Duo T7250. Crossing my
fingers so that it does.</p>

<a href="./posts/beginning_ruby/">Beginning Ruby</a>

</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>These are some very rough/sketchy notes that I took while doing the
exercises on the introductory track of the Ruby language at
<a href="http://www.codeacademy.com/">codeacademy</a>.  They were written from the point-of-view of an amateur
programmer in C and Python (read: "me").</p>

<p>Since this is my first time with Ruby and I only have about 1 week of
experience with it, these notes are likely to contain many mistakes, many
simplifications, many omissions or simply gross errors.  I would love to be
informed of such facts so that I can fix them and not write code that is
burdensome for others to maintain.</p>

<h1 id="operators">Operators</h1>

<ul>
<li>Math operators: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>**</code> (just like Python)</li>
<li>Relational operators: <code>==</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code> (just like other
languages)</li>
<li>Boolean operators: <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>!</code> (just like C/C++/Perl)</li>
<li>The combined comparison operator ("spaceship operator", like Perl): <code>&lt;=&gt;</code>
(follows the spirit of what <code>strcmp</code> in C does)</li>
<li>Conditional assignment operator (<code>||=</code>) only assigns a value to a variable
if that variable is bound to <code>nil</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="numbers">Numbers</h1>

<ul>
<li>You can write number literals embedding an underscore (<code>_</code>) for
readability purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="basicio">Basic I/O</h1>

<ul>
<li>Output: <code>print</code> and <code>puts</code>. Both print strings to stdout, but <code>puts</code> also
appends a new line to the end.</li>
<li>Input: <code>gets</code> accepts an input from stdin and returns a string.</li>
<li>To convert a string <code>foo</code> to an integer, use the <code>Integer(foo)</code>
constructor. It throws an exception if it cannot convert the value.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="strings">Strings</h1>

<ul>
<li>Strings have at least some methods: <code>.length</code>, <code>.reverse</code>, <code>.upcase</code>,
<code>.downcase</code>, <code>.capitalize</code>, <code>.chomp</code> (like Perl, removes the trailing
endline)</li>
<li><code>.upcase</code> seems to have problems with non-ASCII characters, like <code>é</code>.</li>
<li>Interpolation is performed by putting the name <code>name</code> of the variable
inside a string and delimited as <code>#{name}</code> at the place we want the
interpolation to occur.</li>
<li>Methods like <code>.capitalize</code> don't change the string (they return a new
string capitalized).  To change the string, you call the method
<code>.capitalize!</code> (with a <code>!</code> at the end of the name of the method).</li>
<li>Other useful methods: <code>.gsub</code> for globally substituting a regular
expression (and its variant <code>.gsub!</code> for inplace modification), and
<code>.include?</code> to verify if the first string includes another.</li>
<li>Another method: <code>.split(" ")</code>, to split on the string specified as
argument.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="controlflow">Control flow</h1>

<h2 id="if">If</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The syntax of a <code>if</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>if expression1
  block1
elsif expression2
  block2
else
  block3
end
</code></pre>

<p>note that it ends with the word <code>end</code>, there are no need for parentheses,
no braces, no colons, and the keyword for "else if" is <code>elsif</code> (different
from Python's <code>elif</code>).</p></li>
<li>The "<code>if</code>" can also be started with the keyword <code>unless</code> instead, which
checks if the expression is false rather than true (as is the case of
<code>if</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="while">While</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The syntax of the <code>while</code> is similar to other languages:</p>

<pre><code>while condition
  block
end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>A variation of the <code>while</code> is the <code>until</code>, with the same syntax, except
for the <code>until</code> in place of the while, and that it iterates when the
condition is false, instead of true.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="for">For</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The simple case of iterating over a range of numbers is:</p>

<pre><code>for i in 1...10
  block
end
</code></pre>

<p>Like ranges in Python, the 10 is not included (the variable <code>i</code> iterates
from 1 to 9).</p>

<p>For an <em>inclusive</em> range, we use two dots (<code>1..10</code>), instead of three
dots (<code>1...10</code>).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="loop">Loop</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>To iterate a block, we can use the <code>loop</code> keyword, as in:</p>

<pre><code>loop { block } # with braces
</code></pre>

<p>or as in</p>

<pre><code>loop do # note the pair do/end in place of braces
  block
end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>It is useful to use <code>break</code> when using loop to break out of the infinite
iterations.</p></li>
<li>Similarly, we can use <code>next</code> as in other languages (the same as <code>continue</code>
in C or C++).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="arrays">Arrays</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>The equivalent to Python's lists are arrays and they are declared in the
same fashion:</p>

<pre><code>my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Arrays in Ruby are 0-based.</p></li>
<li><p>Every array has an iterator called the <code>.each</code> method. The basic syntax
is:</p>

<pre><code>object.each { |item| block } # do something
</code></pre>

<p>which can be written as:</p>

<pre><code>object.each do |item| block end
</code></pre>

<p>where the name between <code>| |</code> is bound to (a copy of?) each element of
<code>object</code> in turn. The equivalent in Python would be:</p>

<pre><code>for item in object:
    block
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Arrays can be sorted with the <code>.sort</code> method (or its sibling <code>.sort!</code>).
When passing a parameter, it is useful to use the spaceship operator
(<code>&lt;=&gt;</code>) (like Perl) to specify a custom order (similar in spirit to what
we do with Python's <code>key</code> argument to the <code>sort</code> method of a list).
Example:</p>

<pre><code> my_array.sort! {|a, b| a &lt;=&gt; b} # Ascending order
 my_array.sort! {|a, b| b &lt;=&gt; a} # Descending order
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The <code>.push</code> method appends an element to an Array (similar to Python's
<code>.append</code>).</p></li>
<li>The empty Array is denoted by <code>[]</code>, like an empty list in Python.</li>
<li>An iterator (like <code>(1..10)</code>) can be converted to an array with the <code>.to_a</code>
method.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="hashes">Hashes</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>A literal hash is defined by the syntax:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash = {
    "key1" =&gt; "abc",
    "key2" =&gt; 2,
    "key3" =&gt; false
}
</code></pre>

<p>Quite similar to the version in Python:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash = {
    "key1": "abc",
    "key2": 2,
    "key3": False
}
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, in Ruby 1.9, you can write, instead:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash = {
    key1: "abc",
    key2: 2,
    key3: false
}
</code></pre>

<p>which is very similar to Python or JSON.</p></li>
<li><p>The empty hash, OTOH, is defined by calling the constructor <code>.new</code> of the
class <code>Hash</code>:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash = Hash.new
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax used by Python can also be used: <code>my_hash = {}</code></p></li>
<li><p>Iterating over a hash is done the same way as done for an array, but the
<code>.each</code> method gives <em>both</em> the key <em>and</em> the value, as in:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash.each do |k, v|
  puts "#{k}: #{v}"
end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To iterate only on keys, we use the method <code>.each_key</code>. To iterate only on
values, we use the method <code>.each_value</code>.</p></li>
<li>A hash can be sorted with the <code>.sort_by</code> method (to sort by keys, values
or any expression involving them) and since it can be ordered, we can
reverse (in-place) the order of its elements with the <code>.reverse!</code> method.
This makes Ruby's hashes to "taste" like Python's <code>OrderedDict</code>'s.</li>
<li>When one initializes a hash, one can specify a default value to the <code>.new</code>
method (e.g., <code>foo = Hash.new(0)</code>), which makes it convenient to do the
equivalent of Python's <code>defaultdict</code> or <code>Counter</code>.</li>
<li><p>You can select part of a hash by using the <code>.select</code> method and giving it
a block. For example:</p>

<pre><code>good_movies = movie_ratings.select{|k, v| v &gt; 3}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="functionsmethods">Functions/methods</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Functions in Ruby are defined with the word <code>def</code> (as in Python) and end
with the word <code>end</code>, as other composite constructs. Example:</p>

<pre><code>def square(n)
  return n*n
end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Parentheses are optional in Ruby, unless they create ambiguity. So, to
call the function above, one can use any of the following:</p>

<pre><code>square(2)
square 2
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>A function can take a block as a parameter (and this is what <code>.each</code> does,
for instance).</p></li>
<li>Functions can take a variable number of elements with the <em>splash</em>
operator (denoted by <code>*</code>), which puts the extra parameters in an Array
(like Python).</li>
<li>Functions can have default parameters, which are set in the "prototype",
just like in Python or C++.</li>
<li>If the <code>return</code> keyword is omitted from the method, Ruby uses an implicit
return, where the value of the last executed expression is returned to the
caller of the method.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="symbols">Symbols</h1>

<ul>
<li>Any instances of a given symbol share the same ID. This is due to the fact
that they are immutable.</li>
<li>Symbols start with a colon (<code>:</code>) and they can contain any character that
is valid for a variable name.</li>
<li>It is possible to convert between a symbol and a string with the methods
<code>.to_s</code> and <code>.to_sym</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="comments">Comments</h1>

<ul>
<li>Single line comments use the hash symbol (<code>#</code>).</li>
<li>Ruby also has multiline comments, which are delimited by a line beginning
with <code>=begin</code> and a line beginning with <code>=end</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="lambdafunctions">Lambda functions</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>A lambda function in Ruby is defined, as expected, as, for example:</p>

<pre><code>foo = lambda { |x| x.to_sym }
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The basic differences between a lambda and a proc is that:</p>

<ul>
<li>A lambda checks the number of elements that it receives, while a proc
doesn't and assigns <code>nil</code> to parameters that it didn't receive (a proc
seems to ignore extra parameter that it wasn't expecting).</li>
<li>When a lambda returns, the control goes back to the function that called
the lambda, while when a proc returns, the control is returned <em>also</em>
from the function that called the proc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="classes">Classes</h1>

<ul>
<li>"Everything is an object in Ruby." (At least one exception are blocks).</li>
<li>To test if an object is of a given class, you use the method <code>.is_a?</code> on
the object and the type as argument (e.g., <code>foo.is_a? Integer</code>)</li>
<li>The "null" value in Ruby is <code>nil</code>. It is equivalent to <code>None</code> in Python.</li>
<li>The only "falsy" values in Ruby are <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code>. The others are
"truthy", differently from C/C++/Perl/Python.</li>
<li>For a given object, the method <code>.object_id</code> returns what is the "address"
of that object.</li>
<li><p>Classes in Ruby are created with the syntax</p>

<pre><code>class ClassExample
    # body
end
</code></pre>

<p>(That is for a class that has is not derived from other regular classes).</p></li>
<li>Constructors in Ruby are called <code>initialize</code>. An instance of a class is
created by calling the method <code>.new</code> on the class name (and passing
parameters as needed for the <code>initialize</code> method).</li>
<li>Instance variables are named with 1 at sign (<code>@</code>) as a prefix. Class
variables are named with 2 at signs (<code>@@</code>) as a prefix. Global variables
are named with a dollar sign (<code>&#036;</code>) as a prefix.</li>
<li>Class methods are declared inside a class prefixed with <code>self.</code> and they
are called with the class name suffixed with the name of the method. For
example, for a class <code>MyClass</code>, with a class method <code>class_method</code>, we
call it as <code>MyClass.class_method</code>.</li>
<li>When overriding a method in a subclass, one can call the method from the
parent class with the keyword <code>super</code>, as in <code>super(arg1, arg2)</code>.</li>
<li>Ruby doesn't support multiple inheritance. In place of multiple
inheritance, Ruby offers mixins.</li>
<li><p>To access one attribute, say <code>@my_attrib</code>, in Ruby classes, one usually
creates two methods to manipulate it: a method with the name <code>my_attrib</code>,
that returns the value of <code>@my_attrib</code> (a getter) and a method with the
name <code>my_attrib=</code> that accepts a parameter to set <code>@my_attrib</code> to (a
setter).</p>

<p>There is syntatic sugar for creating both getters or setters.</p>

<p>For a getter, you declare <code>attr_reader :my_attrib</code> (the member name as a
symbol).</p>

<p>For a setter, you declare <code>attr_writer :my_attrib</code>.</p>

<p>If you need both a getter and a setter, then you can abbreviate them with
<code>attr_accessor</code>.</p></li>
<li>All methods, by default, are public in Ruby. To explicitly mark something
as public, you use the keyword <code>public</code>. To mark something as private, you
use the keyword <code>private</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="modules">Modules</h1>

<ul>
<li>You can import a module with the keyword <code>require</code> (as in Perl) and the
name of the module in quotes.</li>
<li>One example of a module is the <code>benchmark</code> module, which provides the
<code>Benchmark</code> class, which has the method <code>.realtime</code>, which takes a block
and reports how much time it used.</li>
<li>To create a module, use a syntax similar to that of a class, but
substituting the keyword <code>class</code> with <code>module</code>.</li>
<li>The scope resolution operator in Ruby is the double colon (<code>::</code>), like in
Perl.</li>
<li><p>To create a method inside a module, you have to prefix it by the name of
the module with a dot or with <code>self.</code>, if you want to create a method to
be called outside the module.</p>

<p>The same also holds for creating class methods (as opposed to <em>instance</em>
methods): they can be simply named <code>self.foo</code> to get a class method called
<code>foo</code>.</p></li>
<li>While some modules are already "preloaded" by the interpreter (e.g.,
<code>Math</code>), others need to be explicitly loaded. We do this by using <code>require
'foo'</code> to load the module (in the file <code>foo</code>?).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="mixins">Mixins</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>A mixin is the use of a module to "enrich" a class, adding "instance"
methods of the module to the class.</p>

<p>It is, in a sense, a way to have some of multiple inheritance in Ruby
(without its headaches?)</p></li>
<li>Using the word <code>include Foo</code> imports the items of the module <code>Foo</code> in the
current namespace for <em>instances</em> of a class.</li>
<li>Using the word <code>extend Foo</code> imports the items of the module <code>Foo</code> in the
current namespace as class methods/attributes.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conventions">Conventions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Local variables are named in lower case, with parts separated by
underscores, as in <code>my_name</code>.</li>
<li>Methods that return boolean values have a question mark (<code>?</code>) at the end
of their name.</li>
<li>Methods that have destructive side-effects (like changing their input)
have an exclamation mark (<code>!</code>) at the end of their name.</li>
<li>Code is indented by 2 spaces.</li>
<li>Like other languages, constants are written in all caps, with words
separated by underscores. For example, <code>MAX_VALUE</code>.</li>
<li>Global variables are prefixed with a dollar sign (e.g., <code>&#036;Foo</code>).</li>
<li>Classes are named in camel case (no initial lowercase).</li>
<li>The "poetic mode" in Ruby recommends one to omit the parentheses on
function calls (whenever unambiguous) and, in essence, to write as little
"bureaucracy" (like the explicit <code>return</code> keyword in methods).</li>
</ul>

</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>Not so much ago, we had a boom of new enterprises offering Massive Online
Open Courses (MOOCs for short).</p>

<p>First were Thrun and Norvig (Artificial Intelligence), with Widom
(Introduction to Databases) and Ng (Machine Learning). Then, these initial
experiments led to the creation of Udacity (founded by Thrun) and Coursera
(founded by Ng and Koller).</p>

<p>I have been keeping an eye on them for some time and, in fact, I have been
contributing to a project similar to <a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl">youtube-dl</a> (which
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/youtube-dl">I package for Debian</a>), but focused on downloading videos from
Cousera, called <a href="https://github.com/jplehmann/coursera"><code>coursera-dl</code></a>.</p>

<p>I started contributing to <code>coursera-dl</code> because I wanted to stratch some
itches with downloading with <a href="http://aria2.sourceforge.net/"><code>aria2c</code></a>, but soon the original
author of the project granted me write permission to the repository and I
have been one of the persons that commits the most, which is strange, since
I was not the original creator of the program.</p>

<p>So far, from the courses that grant certificates, I have concluded the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 (Coursera)</li>
<li>Machine Learning (Coursera)</li>
<li>Introduction to Databases (Coursera)</li>
<li>Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation (Coursera)</li>
<li>Introduction to Cryptography I (Coursera)</li>
<li>M101P: MongoDB for Developers (10gen)</li>
<li>M102: MongoDB for DBAs (10gen)</li>
<li>M101J: MongoDB for Java Developers (10gen)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have to say that this have been a pleasant experience, with some of the
courses being challenging, but not up to what an undergraduate course would
be (and the fears of some people that such courses would threaten the
conventional University-style model are a bit far at this point).</p>

<p>Anyway, talking about challenging courses, in particular, prof. Umesh
Vazirani's "Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation" had a lot of
(computational) work and this was one of the courses that prompted me to use
a computer algebra system for manipulating some tedious calculations.</p>

<p>In particular, I used a mix of the <a href="http://www.sagenb.org/">online SAGE math server</a> and
<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a>, whichever I found the syntax to be easier to use for
the problem in question. It is with happiness that I see that there are
efforts to <a href="http://people.debian.org/~thansen/debian-sage-status.html">get SAGE again packaged in Debian</a>.</p>

<p>Another (positively) surprising course has been Dan Boneh's "Introduction to
Cryptography I", which was more theoretical and more serious than what I was
expecting. It even included some nice proof sketches and discussion of
recent results. The last course on cryptography that I took was in 1998 and
<em>a lot</em> of things changed since then, including the way to think about
cryptography. But more on that on a future post.</p>

<p>There are some other courses that I may be completing soon and that I will
post more about, with some reviews of the good and the bad parts of select
ones.</p>

<p>The easiest way of using git locally to commit to a CVS repository is to
have <em>both</em> a git clone of the CVS repository <em>and</em> a CVS checkout of your
repository.</p>

<h1 id="initialstepsthatworkformetm">Initial steps that Work for Me (TM)</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Create your git clone of the CVS repository:</p>

<pre><code>git cvsimport -v -a -A /tmp/lame-authors.txt -k -m -d \
    :ext:rbrito@lame.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lame lame
</code></pre>

<p>The command above will create your clone of the CVS repository in the
current directory which we suppose, for the sake of this discussion, is
<code>/tmp/gitified</code>.</p>

<p>If want to specify a directory different than what you're in, then you
should add the option <code>-C /path/to/git/repository</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a checkout of the CVS repository for CVS work stuff (I'm checking
out things under <code>/tmp</code>):</p>

<pre><code>cvs -z3 -d:ext:rbrito@lame.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lame checkout lame
</code></pre>

<p>This will create your CVS checkout on the directory <code>/tmp/lame</code>, assuming
that you are working under <code>/tmp</code>, as I do.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="doingrealwork">Doing real work</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to your git clone (<code>/tmp/gitified</code>) and start hacking, committing, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>When it is time to send your patches to the CVS repo, you have to:</p>

<pre><code>export GIT_DIR=/tmp/gitified/.git
cd /tmp/lame
git cherry origin master | sed -n 's/^+ //p' | xargs -l1 git cvsexportcommit -c -p -v
</code></pre>

<p>This will automatically check in all the commits that you have made in
the previous step.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="continuingyourworkafterwards">Continuing your work afterwards</h1>

<ol>
<li>First, discard your commits in your git repository, so that you don't get
further problems with <code>git cvsimport</code>.</li>
<li><p>Update your git repository with the current contents of the CVS repo:</p>

<pre><code>cd /tmp/gitified
git cvsimport -v -a -A /tmp/lame-authors.txt -k -m -d \
    :ext:rbrito@lame.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lame lame
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Update your CVS repository with the current contents of the CVS repo too:</p>

<pre><code>cd /tmp/lame
cvs update
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Of course, I would prefer a simpler, leaner workflow. If you happen to have
one, please let me know.</p>

<a href="./posts/lack_of_cooperation_from_ubuntu/">Lack of cooperation from Ubuntu?</a>

</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>I <a href="https://plus.google.com/117659222649141007981/posts/C2vY4nD4CD6">posted the following on Google+</a>, but it is important enough to be
reproduced on Planet. I'm editing it a bit, as it is a followup to my
previous post.</p>

<p>While <a href="http://cynic.cc/blog/posts/debian_activities/">improving the packaging of MongoDB</a>, there was one thing that
caught my attention: that Ubuntu
<a href="http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/universe/m/mongodb/mongodb_2.0.4-1ubuntu2.1/changelog">had already done some of the embedded/convenience libraries work</a>, but
they had <em>not</em> pushed that work to Debian.</p>

<p>Of course, discovered this only after I started working on the improvements
of the package.</p>

<p><strong>What gives, Ubuntu people?</strong></p>

<p>Another thing that I saw is that
<a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mongodb/1:2.2.4-0ubuntu1/+build/4470136">they have patches enabling mongodb working on armhf</a>. Again, they did
<em>not</em> push those to Debian.</p>

<p><strong>Why this lack of cooperation?</strong></p>

<p>Another thing that I saw is that they had packages for version 2.2 (more
precisely, <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/mongodb">raring has 1:2.2.4-0ubuntu1</a>), while Debian sid
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/m/mongodb/mongodb_2.4.1-2/changelog.html">just had 2.0</a> until very recently.</p>

<p><strong>Why not push this work and avoid duplication of work?</strong></p>

<p>By being a good downstream, I intend to push some of the patches to MongoDB
upstream (if they want it), so that we (Debian) have a smaller delta. This
will benefit you Ubuntu guys. Why not join forces and help have a
world-class set of packages?</p>

<p>Please, be good netizens and share the work that you have.  I firmly believe
that the armhf people will be happy to have one of the fancy "cloud"
software available on ARM, especially since the prospects of having ARM
machines on datacenters.</p>

<p>Oh, just for the record, the
<a href="https://github.com/rbrito/mongo-debian/pull/2">kFreeBSD people have sent their contribution</a> and I would love to see
(if possible) this running on the HURD.</p>

<a href="./posts/debian_activities/">Some recent Debian activities</a>

</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>I have been occasionally working on some Debian-related tasks.</p>

<h1 id="chrony">Chrony</h1>

<p>One of those was to get chrony is a slightly better shape, by using, at
least, a patch system (indeed, I "modernized" its packaging with the format
"3.0 (quilt)"), put it in <a href="http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/rbrito-guest/chrony.git">a git repository</a> and would like to receive some
comments on what I have so far.</p>

<p>The bug <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/694690">Debian bug #694690</a> contains a very brief description of my
intentions and of the problems that I see in the current package. IMVHO, it
is a very nice NTP client and server and it could even be used as the
default for Debian, once it gets in shape.  There is at least another
high-profile distribution, namely Fedora, that
<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/ChronyDefaultNTP">switched to chrony as its default NTP software</a>. We can certainly take a
look at what they are doing and join forces here.</p>

<h1 id="mongodb">MongoDB</h1>

<p>Another package where I spent some time was with <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/mongodb">mongodb</a>:
MongoDB is a tricky package that is only built for 2 arches: amd64 and
i386.  The version in unstable for i386 was 2.0.x (roughly the same as for
wheezy), which the version in unstable for amd64 was 2.4.1, which has many
features that 2.0 lacks.</p>

<p>The packaging of it is a bit tricky, since the source tree has bazillion
embedded/convenience libraries (e.g., Google's v8, Mozilla's spidermonkey,
BOOST, Google's Snappy, PCRE 3 etc.). Up to version 2.4.1-2, it used all
these convenience copies, which is of course, a problem for a distribution
like Debian.</p>

<p><a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/m/mongodb/news/20130417T171917Z.html">I changed</a> part of the build process to use the libraries that we
already have in Debian and, as Antonin Kral uploaded this newer version,
unsurprisingly the binary packages are smaller (especially if you take into
account that a handful of the libraries may already be installed on the
system).</p>

<p>A few hours later, Antonin uploaded a new upstream version, which means that
we now have better MongoDB packages to play with.  I am, in fact, really
playing with MongoDB as my first NoSQL database, since
<a href="https://education.10gen.com/courses/10gen/M101/2012_Fall/about">10gen is giving an introductory course</a> on how it works and my
motivation was to get what we have in Debian in shape for the course.</p>

<p>You can say that I am a firm believer of the "eat your own dogfood"
principle.</p>

<p>Regarding MongoDB only being built for i386 and amd64, the BTS
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/703061">has a patch</a> to enable building for kFreeBSD, but the patch is for the
2.0 series and the code has changed so drastically in relation to the 2.4
series that there is no hope of it applying.  It would be super nice to have
MongoDB working on kFreeBSD and on HURD also, though.</p>

<h1 id="nocache">nocache</h1>

<p>There is a very nice command line program called <code>nocache</code> that was packaged
by Dmitry Smirnov (and just approved by the FTP masters!) whose packaging I
briefly reviewed per Dmitry's request and this is an amazing utility whose
purpose is to bypass/minimize file system caching for a program.</p>

<p>This is especially useful when you are making backups (reading lots of files
that would, otherwise, fill the filesystem cache, even if they are not used
frequently) or if you are just streaming one file (possibly larger than the
system's RAM) to another computer and you have no need to use the file
immediately after that.</p>

<p>It performs its job by using the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> mechanism and using
<code>posix_fadvise</code>'s flag <code>POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED</code> for the files that will be
touched.</p>

<h1 id="postnote">Post note</h1>

<p>Oh, just one aside: for the readers of Debian Planet and other aggregation
services which are not Debian Developers/Maintainers, I contributed to these
packages without being the maintainer of them, just scratching some itches
and contributing back what I produced.</p>

</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>Let's suppose that you went to a show of your favourite some time ago and
you were able to sneak in a camera (well, in those times, cell phones
weren't able to record much more than 176x144 pixels at 12fps).</p>

<p>But, then, you suddenly found that some people uploaded (short) fragments of
that very same show to youtube and, collecting those, you may be able to
create a "multi-camera" version of the video that you can record to keep of
your memorable concert.</p>

<p>The multi-camera, in the sense above, is not the same as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Video#Chapters_and_angles">multiple angles</a> (like some DVDs), but something like a TV broadcast,
where the stage is filmed by cameras positioned at some places and the image
that is broadcast is switched from time to time according to that who is
singing, or playing etc.</p>

<p>So, Dear Lazyweb, do we happen to have any Free Software (preferably already
packaged in Debian) that is able to help with the task of "aligning" (in
time) videos from various (different) sources so as to produce one
multi-camera video?</p>

<p>What would my options be? I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e7IPeuK1tQ&amp;lc=Zwz7xq5ANT43j64jh8zLRYCMVRnJQgINcgSOhf-5Ozg">asked this</a> on youtube for a person that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e7IPeuK1tQ">did exactly what I want</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e7IPeuK1tQ&amp;lc=Zwz7xq5ANT6jkGhCF9g1RzmZAsFIGmYzChDJwqwovNc">their answer</a> was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Vegas_Pro">Sony Vegas</a>,
which I fear that does not exactly would be allowed in Debian. <img src="./smileys/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>Any comments are welcome, thanks, and if I am successful, I will upload the
final video. <img src="./smileys/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>I was with some spare time a few days ago and I took one of those stupid
tests that are so popular in the Internet. Well, here are the results,
saying that I am, indeed, a Geek, which does not surprise me that much. <img src="./smileys/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>I did expect my Math score to be higher than everything else (I'm only in
the 90th percentile with respect to this), while I am high on the Computer
side of things (in the 97th percentile).</p>

<p>I guess that I should devote myself to more Mathematics and writing less
code. <img src="./smileys/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>
