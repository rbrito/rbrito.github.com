<a href="./posts/2014-02-23-trivial_fact_3/">Trivial fact #3: Continued fractions via matrices</a>

</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<h1 id="note">Note</h1>

<p>Apparently, it's not Debian planet that has problems to deal with MathJax
(which makes posts usingn it appear illegible on Debian planet), but the
<a href="https://github.com/rbrito/ikiwiki-plugin-mathjax">ikiwiki plugin</a> that I am using which generates garbage in the feeds
that get consumed by planet.debian.org.</p>

<p>If you it know of a better plugin (which doesn't generate such output)
please let me know, <em>especially</em> if it is not super computationally
expensive for a Core 2 Duo T7250 (which is my notebook).</p>

<h1 id="therealthing">The real thing</h1>

<p>As <a href="http://wstein.org/">William Stein</a> is now offering a course on Number Theory and he has
been posting recorded videos of his lectures, I started watching some of
them (mainly, the ones regarding continued factions).  In particular, he
shows the usual recursive formula for convergents of a continued fraction
and that's super nice.</p>

<p>For the curious reader, the recurrence relations for the convergents of
\([a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n, \ldots]\) are:
\[
p_n = a_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}\\
q_n = a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2},
\] with initial conditions (\(p_{-2} = 0\), \(p_{-1} = 1\), \(p_0 = a_0\),
\(q_{-2} = 1\), \(q_{-1} = 0\), \(q_0 = 1\)).</p>

<p>He even motivated the use of continued fractions with the golden ratio,
which is super nice, given that I like the subject and have been writing a
document collecting facts that I know about the Fibonacci numbers (well,
this document is horribly incomplete and not even close to something that I
would consider proper for public consumption&mdash;I plan on publishing
them soon).</p>

<p>OK, after he discussed the basics of it convergents, he noted that the
recurrence relations are like those defining the Fibonacci numbers, just
that one of the terms is "weighted" by the coefficients of the continued
fraction.</p>

<p>I missed one thing, though: neither <a href="http://wstein.org/ent/">his book</a> nor wikipedia's article on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continued%20fractions">continued fractions</a> mentions a very neat, alternative way to
express the convergents of continued fractions (truth be said, I took a
quick peek at wikipedia's article and I found that it doesn't mentionat
least explicitly, in a 1 min skim&mdash;it may well be buried somewhere
else).</p>

<p>I, then, <a href="https://plus.google.com/115360165819500279592/posts/guGv6w9jmxr">proposed</a> the following exercise for his students (which he
apparently liked, as he +1's the suggestion):</p>

<p>Prove that the recurrence relation of the \(p_i\)'s and \(q_i\)'s that we
mentioned before can be obtained via matrix multiplication. More precisely,
prove that:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
a_0 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a_1 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
\cdots
\begin{bmatrix}
a_n &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
 =
\begin{bmatrix}
p_n &amp; p_{n-1}\\
q_n &amp; q_{n-1}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
As a corollary, derive Cassini's identity for the Fibonacci Numbers.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Please, if you any errors on this, please let me know so that I can fix it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit:</em></strong> Thanks "noone" for spotting a typographical error.</p>

<a href="./posts/2014-02-17-youtube-dl_news/">Some new Youtube-dl functionality</a>

</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>I wrote in a <a href="./posts/2013-10-23-assorted_news/#youtube-dl">previous post</a> that
Youtube changed their way of delivering videos, with the use of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic%20Adaptive%20Streaming%20over%20HTTP">Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP</a>.  On top of that, they
started serving both the audio and the video in separate streams, which
meant trouble for downloader tools like <a href="http://youtube-dl.org/"><code>youtube-dl</code></a>.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in that previous post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What does this mean in practical terms for users of youtube-dl?  Well, if
  you wanted to download videos in resolutions like the 480p (format 35)
  that I mentioned, then you will probably have to change your way of doing
  things, until a more automated solution is in place.</p>
  
  <p>You will have to download both the audio and the video and, then,
  "combine" them (that is, multiplex them) to create one "normal" video file
  with both the audio and the video.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And latter, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Otherwise, to download 480p videos (which I do for lectures and so on with
  other projects of mine, like edx-dl) I have to call youtube-dl twice: once
  for format 135 and another for format 140, since the old <img src="./smileys/question.png" alt="(?)" /> format 35
  files are much smaller than the lower resolution 360p files (due to the
  former being encoded in High profile vs. the latter being encoded in
  Constrained Baseline profile).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(...)</p>

<p>Well, now, we don't have this problem anymore:</p>

<p>The new release of <code>youtube-dl</code> brings us many goodies, including that it is
possible to <em>automatically</em> combine/merge/multiplex audio and video formats
that Youtube now offers separately (See the previous comments about separate
audio and video).</p>

<p>Now, if you want a 480p video in H.264 format, High profile, with 128kbps
AAC audio (this used to be Youtube's format 35), you can specify format <code>-f
135+140</code> on the command-line and it will download both the audio, the video
and multiplex it with <code>ffmpeg</code> (or <code>avconv</code>, depending on what you have
installed).</p>

<p>Besides being convenient, this automatic downloading and merging makes it
unnecessary to write scripts to, say, retrieve all the videos in a playlist
that contains a lot of lectures (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPQgeAz264g&amp;list=PLA58AC5CABC1321A3">one example here</a>, taught by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict%20Gross">Benedict Gross</a>).</p>

<p>Version 2014.02.17 of <code>youtube-dl</code> will be soon in your favorite mirror of
the Debian archives.</p>

<h1 id="initsystem">Init system</h1>

<p>I am happy that Debian's Technical Committee was able to reach a very good
decision with the choice of systemd as the default init system for the Linux
ports.</p>

<p>In particular, I was very pleasantly surprised by the lucidity of Russ
Allbery's analyses and, above all, his <em>patience</em> even with people that, in
my understanding, were just being trolls or trying to cause confusion and
disrupt a process that was already chaotic.</p>

<p>Russ, thank you for your exemplary role.</p>

<p>(Also, you type fast or what? You fill whole e-mails seemingly faster than I
can read!)</p>

<h2 id="unexpectedunionofforces">Unexpected union of forces</h2>

<p>It seems to me that Mark Shutterworth's <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1316">decision</a> of (perhaps?)
embracing Debian's decision in the init system is a good thing.</p>

<p>I think that one way where Ubuntu did a great thing with respect to Debian
was their initial attitude towards cherry-picking the best of breed of Free
Software from Debian's archive and polishing that to create a really "for
human beings" operating system.  I hope that this means that, at least in
part, money (Mark's?) can be channeled in the best of the interests so that
we all gain from it.</p>

<p>(And, to be honest, I see no problem in making money with Free Software and
I welcome a well done integration job).</p>

<h1 id="morepolarizingthings">More polarizing things</h1>

<p>I feel that, now, I may even have some hope of sending another
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/729203">potentially polarizing</a> bug to the Tech Ctte (that is ffmpeg vs. libav)
and have faith that some rational decision would be made.</p>

<p>I was not even aware of it, but the ffmpeg folks even
<a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/">featured a news item in their page</a> of me having filed the RFP bug
mentioned above.</p>

<h1 id="debconf14">DebConf 14</h1>

<p>If everything goes as expected, I hope to attend this year's DebConf.  In
fact, I am anticipating this, since I would love to, e.g., talk with Joey
Hess and discuss a better way of having <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU parallel</a> and the <code>parallel</code>
program in <a href="http://packages.debian.org/moreutils">moreutils</a> have amicable co-installability among many,
many other things with respect to my packages.</p>

<p>And, quite probably, work on packaging ffmpeg with other interested people
(which seem to be numerous).</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Fix markdown link pointing twice to the ffmpeg site. Thanks
Marius Gedminas for pointing this out.</p>

</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>I don't know how Debian planet deals with MathJax (it seems to
become illegible), but I will try to post this, anyway.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Fact:</strong> Since the harmonic numbers can be approximated by the
natural logarithm, that is, \(H_n \simeq \ln n\), we can clearly
see that
\[
 \frac{1}{i+1} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n} = H_n - H_i \simeq \ln n - \ln i = \ln \frac{n}{i},
\]
which is a trivial approximation that may be handy sometimes.</p>

<a href="./posts/2014-01-17-developing_for_android_with_debian/">Developing for Android with Debian</a>

</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>I have just enrolled in a MOOC to learn about programming with Android.
There are many tutorials and reports of people using Linux for the
development of the apps out there, but, unfortunately, many of them are
outdated or contain misleading information.</p>

<p>You will find bazillion instructions out there telling you to install
JDK6. (Even the instructions in the MOOCs say so, and Google says that it is
the only supported version of Java). Even more than that, some of them will
tell you that you should <em>not</em> use OpenJDK, but use Oracle's JDK instead.</p>

<p>So, if you have a pure <code>amd64</code> system and you try to install the x86-64
version of Google's Android Developer Tools (ADT), you are going to have a
surprise: you will have all sorts of programs telling you that you have file
not found, even though the required binaries are there.</p>

<p>(This is, of course, besides install <code>openjdk-7-jdk</code>, if you wish to use the
integrated Eclipse environment).</p>

<p>Turns out that the so-called 64-bit ADT/SDK actually has many 32-bit
executables(!) and they aren't statically linked. Inspecting them, I needed
the following packages:</p>

<pre><code>    gcc-4.8-base:i386
    libc6-i686:i386
    libc6:i386
    libgcc1:i386
    libstdc++6:i386
    zlib1g:i386
</code></pre>

<p>It is worth observing that:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>libstdc++6:i386</code> depends (transitively) on <code>libc6:i386</code>, <code>libgcc1:i386</code>,
and <code>gcc-4.8-base:i386</code>.</li>
<li><code>zlib1g:i386</code> depends (transitively) on <code>libc6:i386</code>, <code>libgcc1:i386</code>, and
<code>gcc-4.8-base:i386</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the above, and given that the version of the GCC libraries can vary a
lot, it is perhaps better to simply do something like:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install libstdc++6:i386 zlib1g:i386
</code></pre>

<p>Although not necessary, since you are using an amd64 machine, your computer
already supports many more recent instructions that will be used if you
install the package <code>libc6-i686:i386</code>.</p>

<p>To avoid the emulator from spitting out error messages related to <code>libGL.so</code>,
install <code>libgl1-mesa-dev</code> (note: <em>not</em> <code>i386</code> here).</p>

<p>This way, you will be able to run the embedded QEMU with full KVM
acceleration if you pass the options <code>-qemu -m 1024 -enable-kvm</code> on
Eclipse's "Run > Run Configurations... > Target > Additional Emulator
Command Line Options".</p>

<p>After that, you are probably good to go.</p>

</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>Just a trivial fact: every polyhedron that is used in linear programming is
convex, that is \(Ax \leq b\) is convex, for a matrix \(A\) and a (column)
vector \(b\).</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong> Take any \(x', x''\) that satisfy the system of inequalities \(Ax \leq b\).
Then, for \(0 \leq \lambda \leq 1\), we have that \(\lambda Ax' \leq \lambda b\),
that is \(A \lambda x' \leq \lambda b\).  Similarly, for \(x''\), we have
that \(A (1-\lambda) x' \leq (1-\lambda) b\). Summing the inequalities, we
get:
\[
 A[\lambda x' + (1-\lambda) x''] \leq [\lambda + (1-\lambda)] b = b,
\]
which means that \(\hat{x} = \lambda x' + (1-\lambda) x''\) is again a
solution of the original set of inequalities, thus concluding the argument.</p>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>This post is just a bunch of random notes, but I think that things are going
well, this time.</p>

<h1 id="btrfs">Btrfs</h1>

<p>Just started playing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/btrfs">btrfs</a> after converting a 2TB disk
with about 1.3TB of data from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ext4">ext4</a> to btrfs.  This particular
filesystem contains my backup data and I hope that btrfs is able to live up
to high standards.</p>

<p>I will probably write a detailed review with my impressions, but suffice to
say that it is working fine and I hope that I will be happy for a long time
to come. My other filesystems, for the moment, will be ext4.</p>

<h1 id="courseradownloader">Coursera Downloader</h1>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/jplehmann">John Lehmann</a>'s generosity, now <code>coursera-dl</code> has a new home:
a <a href="https://github.com/coursera-dl">github organization</a> of its own!</p>

<h1 id="youtube-dl">youtube-dl</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/1612">Some people may have noticed, others may not</a>, but when downloading
videos from Youtube, they apparently are getting more aggressive with the
use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic%20Adaptive%20Streaming%20over%20HTTP">Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP</a> (also called
DASH) and, as a result, some (perhaps going to be all in the near future?)
of the videos may not be available in the resolution/formats that you used
to like (like me, with format number 35).</p>

<p>By the way, one thing that is interesting with youtube videos provided via
DASH is that they are available in different streams: one for the video and
another for the audio.</p>

<p>What does this mean in practical terms for users of youtube-dl?  Well, if
you wanted to download videos in resolutions like the 480p (format 35) that
I mentioned, then you will probably have to change your way of doing things,
until a more automated solution is in place.</p>

<p>You will have to download both the audio and the video and, then, "combine"
them (that is, multiplex them) to create one "normal" video file with both
the audio and the video. I usually do this via:</p>

<p><code>
ffmpeg -i audio.m4a -i video.mp4 -vcodec copy -acodec copy combined.mp4
</code></p>

<p>If you prefer having a Matroska container instead of an mp4 container
(which, BTW, results in <em>smaller</em> muxing overhead), then you can use the
command line:</p>

<p><code>
mkvmerge -o combined.mkv audio.m4a video.mp4
</code></p>

<p>Oh, those <code>m4a</code> and <code>mp4</code> extensions are a new addition that
<a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/pull/1622">I just sent upstream</a> (in the past, both would have been named with an
extension of <code>mp4</code>).</p>

<p>As, an aside, I like formats <code>135</code> for video and <code>140</code> for audio, for the
reasons that I mentioned in a comments to issue 1612:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Otherwise, to download 480p videos (which I do for lectures and so on with
  other projects of mine, like edx-dl) I have to call youtube-dl twice: once
  for format 135 and another for format 140, since the old <img src="./smileys/question.png" alt="(?)" /> format 35
  files are much smaller than the lower resolution 360p files (due to the
  former being encoded in High profile vs. the latter being encoded in
  Constrained Baseline profile).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this is unfortunate for some, this is a good thing for others: I once
had a blind user of <code>youtube-dl</code> asking me if he could avoid downloading the
whole video just to extract the audio, so that he save on bandwidth. Well,
now this is possible.</p>

<p>Expect a new version of <code>youtube-dl</code> to be uploaded soon to Debian unstable.</p>

<h1 id="music">Music</h1>

<p>It is so nice to see the music that I like getting better. It was
particularly pleasant to <a href="https://youtu.be/hAnVFJFmFx8">see</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarja%20Turunen">Tarja Turunen</a> being joined
on stage by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor%20Jansen">Floor Jansen</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, it is my impression that the once female-fronted bands are getting
more and more into collaborations and side-projects and they are, in many
ways, getting more refined. Examples of this includes Floor, Tarja,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anneke%20van%20Giersbergen">Anneke van Giersbergen</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon%20den%20Adel">Sharon den Adel</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari%20Ruesl%C3%A5tten">Kari Rueslåtten</a> and many others that I can't remember right
now.</p>

<p>Of course, some thanks to people that take the time to film, and
upload/share the videos so that other people not at these events can watch
them is highly appreciated and they usually are treated as anonymous, but,
of course, this should be fixed.</p>

remember which one), and people told me that they liked this information and
said that others would profit from it if I posted it on my blog, which I now
decided to post.</p>

<p>The context: for homework of one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOOC">MOOC</a>, people were trying to
download a large virtual machine image that was offered both via an official
HTTP source, which was slow.</p>

<p>A person volunteered that already had downloaded the image volunteered to
create a bittorrent to help fellow students.</p>

<p>Other students started saying that the bittorrent download was faster up to
a certain point and, then, things slowed down a lot. Of course, they got
faster to the point where lots of pieces were already well distributed and,
then, only the everybody had already downloaded things and, then, only the
seeder had the missing segments of the torrent.</p>

<p>Then I commented with:</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Depending on your bittorrent client, you can add the original HTTP
  download as a "Web seed" and, this way, your client will download <em>both</em>
  from the peers and also from the web to fill in parts that are not yet
  available.</p>
  
  <p>One such client is the Free (as in Freedom) <a href="http://qbittorrent.sf.net/">qbittorrent</a>, but I guess
  that others also have this option.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Soon after that, people started downloading things much faster.</p>

<a href="./posts/sna_acceleration_vs_uxa/">SNA Acceleration vs. UXA Acceleration</a>

</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>Seeing as recent versions of Xorg have made it into Debian's testing (which
I am using right now, instead of my usual sid installations), I decided to
see what they would bring me in terms of performance, since they have the
SNA acceleration implemented as well as the standard UXA acceleration.</p>

<p>Well, I did not have any other tests to perform, but below are the results
on my wife's laptop (a Core i5 2410M), when running <a href="http://packages.debian.org/gtkperf">gtkperf</a>:</p>

<h1 id="withuxa">With UXA</h1>

<pre><code>GtkPerf 0.40 - Starting testing: Mon Aug 12 20:33:20 2013

GtkEntry - time:  0.19
GtkComboBox - time:  5.36
GtkComboBoxEntry - time:  3.59
GtkSpinButton - time:  0.60
GtkProgressBar - time:  0.41
GtkToggleButton - time:  0.73
GtkCheckButton - time:  0.48
GtkRadioButton - time:  0.97
GtkTextView - Add text - time: 21.72
GtkTextView - Scroll - time:  2.29
GtkDrawingArea - Lines - time:  6.18
GtkDrawingArea - Circles - time:  6.74
GtkDrawingArea - Text - time:  4.32
GtkDrawingArea - Pixbufs - time:  0.67
 --- 
Total time: 54.25
</code></pre>

<h1 id="withsna">With SNA</h1>

<pre><code>GtkPerf 0.40 - Starting testing: Mon Aug 12 20:36:58 2013

GtkEntry - time:  0.21
GtkComboBox - time:  4.86
GtkComboBoxEntry - time:  2.67
GtkSpinButton - time:  0.59
GtkProgressBar - time:  0.24
GtkToggleButton - time:  0.61
GtkCheckButton - time:  0.51
GtkRadioButton - time:  1.00
GtkTextView - Add text - time: 17.19
GtkTextView - Scroll - time:  1.84
GtkDrawingArea - Lines - time:  2.70
GtkDrawingArea - Circles - time:  2.65
GtkDrawingArea - Text - time:  1.72
GtkDrawingArea - Pixbufs - time:  0.11
 --- 
Total time: 36.91
</code></pre>

<p>So, with SNA, the timing that I get are almost 2 times lower, which is
superb for a very simple <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> config file:</p>

<pre><code>Section "Device"
        Identifier "Intel Graphics"
        Driver "intel"
        Option "AccelMethod" "sna"
EndSection
</code></pre>

<p>I have not noticed any change, but if drawing graphics faster means that I
get a bit more of battery life, then I will be super happy. I still have not
tested if this works on my notebook with a Core2Duo T7250. Crossing my
fingers so that it does.</p>

<a href="./posts/beginning_ruby/">Beginning Ruby</a>

</header>
</section>

<section class="inlinecontent">
<p>These are some very rough/sketchy notes that I took while doing the
exercises on the introductory track of the Ruby language at
<a href="http://www.codeacademy.com/">codeacademy</a>.  They were written from the point-of-view of an amateur
programmer in C and Python (read: "me").</p>

<p>Since this is my first time with Ruby and I only have about 1 week of
experience with it, these notes are likely to contain many mistakes, many
simplifications, many omissions or simply gross errors.  I would love to be
informed of such facts so that I can fix them and not write code that is
burdensome for others to maintain.</p>

<h1 id="operators">Operators</h1>

<ul>
<li>Math operators: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>**</code> (just like Python)</li>
<li>Relational operators: <code>==</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code> (just like other
languages)</li>
<li>Boolean operators: <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>!</code> (just like C/C++/Perl)</li>
<li>The combined comparison operator ("spaceship operator", like Perl): <code>&lt;=&gt;</code>
(follows the spirit of what <code>strcmp</code> in C does)</li>
<li>Conditional assignment operator (<code>||=</code>) only assigns a value to a variable
if that variable is bound to <code>nil</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="numbers">Numbers</h1>

<ul>
<li>You can write number literals embedding an underscore (<code>_</code>) for
readability purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="basicio">Basic I/O</h1>

<ul>
<li>Output: <code>print</code> and <code>puts</code>. Both print strings to stdout, but <code>puts</code> also
appends a new line to the end.</li>
<li>Input: <code>gets</code> accepts an input from stdin and returns a string.</li>
<li>To convert a string <code>foo</code> to an integer, use the <code>Integer(foo)</code>
constructor. It throws an exception if it cannot convert the value.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="strings">Strings</h1>

<ul>
<li>Strings have at least some methods: <code>.length</code>, <code>.reverse</code>, <code>.upcase</code>,
<code>.downcase</code>, <code>.capitalize</code>, <code>.chomp</code> (like Perl, removes the trailing
endline)</li>
<li><code>.upcase</code> seems to have problems with non-ASCII characters, like <code>é</code>.</li>
<li>Interpolation is performed by putting the name <code>name</code> of the variable
inside a string and delimited as <code>#{name}</code> at the place we want the
interpolation to occur.</li>
<li>Methods like <code>.capitalize</code> don't change the string (they return a new
string capitalized).  To change the string, you call the method
<code>.capitalize!</code> (with a <code>!</code> at the end of the name of the method).</li>
<li>Other useful methods: <code>.gsub</code> for globally substituting a regular
expression (and its variant <code>.gsub!</code> for inplace modification), and
<code>.include?</code> to verify if the first string includes another.</li>
<li>Another method: <code>.split(" ")</code>, to split on the string specified as
argument.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="controlflow">Control flow</h1>

<h2 id="if">If</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The syntax of a <code>if</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>if expression1
  block1
elsif expression2
  block2
else
  block3
end
</code></pre>

<p>note that it ends with the word <code>end</code>, there are no need for parentheses,
no braces, no colons, and the keyword for "else if" is <code>elsif</code> (different
from Python's <code>elif</code>).</p></li>
<li>The "<code>if</code>" can also be started with the keyword <code>unless</code> instead, which
checks if the expression is false rather than true (as is the case of
<code>if</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="while">While</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The syntax of the <code>while</code> is similar to other languages:</p>

<pre><code>while condition
  block
end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>A variation of the <code>while</code> is the <code>until</code>, with the same syntax, except
for the <code>until</code> in place of the while, and that it iterates when the
condition is false, instead of true.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="for">For</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The simple case of iterating over a range of numbers is:</p>

<pre><code>for i in 1...10
  block
end
</code></pre>

<p>Like ranges in Python, the 10 is not included (the variable <code>i</code> iterates
from 1 to 9).</p>

<p>For an <em>inclusive</em> range, we use two dots (<code>1..10</code>), instead of three
dots (<code>1...10</code>).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="loop">Loop</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>To iterate a block, we can use the <code>loop</code> keyword, as in:</p>

<pre><code>loop { block } # with braces
</code></pre>

<p>or as in</p>

<pre><code>loop do # note the pair do/end in place of braces
  block
end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>It is useful to use <code>break</code> when using loop to break out of the infinite
iterations.</p></li>
<li>Similarly, we can use <code>next</code> as in other languages (the same as <code>continue</code>
in C or C++).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="arrays">Arrays</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>The equivalent to Python's lists are arrays and they are declared in the
same fashion:</p>

<pre><code>my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Arrays in Ruby are 0-based.</p></li>
<li><p>Every array has an iterator called the <code>.each</code> method. The basic syntax
is:</p>

<pre><code>object.each { |item| block } # do something
</code></pre>

<p>which can be written as:</p>

<pre><code>object.each do |item| block end
</code></pre>

<p>where the name between <code>| |</code> is bound to (a copy of?) each element of
<code>object</code> in turn. The equivalent in Python would be:</p>

<pre><code>for item in object:
    block
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Arrays can be sorted with the <code>.sort</code> method (or its sibling <code>.sort!</code>).
When passing a parameter, it is useful to use the spaceship operator
(<code>&lt;=&gt;</code>) (like Perl) to specify a custom order (similar in spirit to what
we do with Python's <code>key</code> argument to the <code>sort</code> method of a list).
Example:</p>

<pre><code> my_array.sort! {|a, b| a &lt;=&gt; b} # Ascending order
 my_array.sort! {|a, b| b &lt;=&gt; a} # Descending order
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The <code>.push</code> method appends an element to an Array (similar to Python's
<code>.append</code>).</p></li>
<li>The empty Array is denoted by <code>[]</code>, like an empty list in Python.</li>
<li>An iterator (like <code>(1..10)</code>) can be converted to an array with the <code>.to_a</code>
method.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="hashes">Hashes</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>A literal hash is defined by the syntax:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash = {
    "key1" =&gt; "abc",
    "key2" =&gt; 2,
    "key3" =&gt; false
}
</code></pre>

<p>Quite similar to the version in Python:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash = {
    "key1": "abc",
    "key2": 2,
    "key3": False
}
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, in Ruby 1.9, you can write, instead:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash = {
    key1: "abc",
    key2: 2,
    key3: false
}
</code></pre>

<p>which is very similar to Python or JSON.</p></li>
<li><p>The empty hash, OTOH, is defined by calling the constructor <code>.new</code> of the
class <code>Hash</code>:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash = Hash.new
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax used by Python can also be used: <code>my_hash = {}</code></p></li>
<li><p>Iterating over a hash is done the same way as done for an array, but the
<code>.each</code> method gives <em>both</em> the key <em>and</em> the value, as in:</p>

<pre><code>my_hash.each do |k, v|
  puts "#{k}: #{v}"
end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To iterate only on keys, we use the method <code>.each_key</code>. To iterate only on
values, we use the method <code>.each_value</code>.</p></li>
<li>A hash can be sorted with the <code>.sort_by</code> method (to sort by keys, values
or any expression involving them) and since it can be ordered, we can
reverse (in-place) the order of its elements with the <code>.reverse!</code> method.
This makes Ruby's hashes to "taste" like Python's <code>OrderedDict</code>'s.</li>
<li>When one initializes a hash, one can specify a default value to the <code>.new</code>
method (e.g., <code>foo = Hash.new(0)</code>), which makes it convenient to do the
equivalent of Python's <code>defaultdict</code> or <code>Counter</code>.</li>
<li><p>You can select part of a hash by using the <code>.select</code> method and giving it
a block. For example:</p>

<pre><code>good_movies = movie_ratings.select{|k, v| v &gt; 3}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="functionsmethods">Functions/methods</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Functions in Ruby are defined with the word <code>def</code> (as in Python) and end
with the word <code>end</code>, as other composite constructs. Example:</p>

<pre><code>def square(n)
  return n*n
end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Parentheses are optional in Ruby, unless they create ambiguity. So, to
call the function above, one can use any of the following:</p>

<pre><code>square(2)
square 2
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>A function can take a block as a parameter (and this is what <code>.each</code> does,
for instance).</p></li>
<li>Functions can take a variable number of elements with the <em>splash</em>
operator (denoted by <code>*</code>), which puts the extra parameters in an Array
(like Python).</li>
<li>Functions can have default parameters, which are set in the "prototype",
just like in Python or C++.</li>
<li>If the <code>return</code> keyword is omitted from the method, Ruby uses an implicit
return, where the value of the last executed expression is returned to the
caller of the method.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="symbols">Symbols</h1>

<ul>
<li>Any instances of a given symbol share the same ID. This is due to the fact
that they are immutable.</li>
<li>Symbols start with a colon (<code>:</code>) and they can contain any character that
is valid for a variable name.</li>
<li>It is possible to convert between a symbol and a string with the methods
<code>.to_s</code> and <code>.to_sym</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="comments">Comments</h1>

<ul>
<li>Single line comments use the hash symbol (<code>#</code>).</li>
<li>Ruby also has multiline comments, which are delimited by a line beginning
with <code>=begin</code> and a line beginning with <code>=end</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="lambdafunctions">Lambda functions</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>A lambda function in Ruby is defined, as expected, as, for example:</p>

<pre><code>foo = lambda { |x| x.to_sym }
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The basic differences between a lambda and a proc is that:</p>

<ul>
<li>A lambda checks the number of elements that it receives, while a proc
doesn't and assigns <code>nil</code> to parameters that it didn't receive (a proc
seems to ignore extra parameter that it wasn't expecting).</li>
<li>When a lambda returns, the control goes back to the function that called
the lambda, while when a proc returns, the control is returned <em>also</em>
from the function that called the proc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="classes">Classes</h1>

<ul>
<li>"Everything is an object in Ruby." (At least one exception are blocks).</li>
<li>To test if an object is of a given class, you use the method <code>.is_a?</code> on
the object and the type as argument (e.g., <code>foo.is_a? Integer</code>)</li>
<li>The "null" value in Ruby is <code>nil</code>. It is equivalent to <code>None</code> in Python.</li>
<li>The only "falsy" values in Ruby are <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code>. The others are
"truthy", differently from C/C++/Perl/Python.</li>
<li>For a given object, the method <code>.object_id</code> returns what is the "address"
of that object.</li>
<li><p>Classes in Ruby are created with the syntax</p>

<pre><code>class ClassExample
    # body
end
</code></pre>

<p>(That is for a class that has is not derived from other regular classes).</p></li>
<li>Constructors in Ruby are called <code>initialize</code>. An instance of a class is
created by calling the method <code>.new</code> on the class name (and passing
parameters as needed for the <code>initialize</code> method).</li>
<li>Instance variables are named with 1 at sign (<code>@</code>) as a prefix. Class
variables are named with 2 at signs (<code>@@</code>) as a prefix. Global variables
are named with a dollar sign (<code>&#036;</code>) as a prefix.</li>
<li>Class methods are declared inside a class prefixed with <code>self.</code> and they
are called with the class name suffixed with the name of the method. For
example, for a class <code>MyClass</code>, with a class method <code>class_method</code>, we
call it as <code>MyClass.class_method</code>.</li>
<li>When overriding a method in a subclass, one can call the method from the
parent class with the keyword <code>super</code>, as in <code>super(arg1, arg2)</code>.</li>
<li>Ruby doesn't support multiple inheritance. In place of multiple
inheritance, Ruby offers mixins.</li>
<li><p>To access one attribute, say <code>@my_attrib</code>, in Ruby classes, one usually
creates two methods to manipulate it: a method with the name <code>my_attrib</code>,
that returns the value of <code>@my_attrib</code> (a getter) and a method with the
name <code>my_attrib=</code> that accepts a parameter to set <code>@my_attrib</code> to (a
setter).</p>

<p>There is syntatic sugar for creating both getters or setters.</p>

<p>For a getter, you declare <code>attr_reader :my_attrib</code> (the member name as a
symbol).</p>

<p>For a setter, you declare <code>attr_writer :my_attrib</code>.</p>

<p>If you need both a getter and a setter, then you can abbreviate them with
<code>attr_accessor</code>.</p></li>
<li>All methods, by default, are public in Ruby. To explicitly mark something
as public, you use the keyword <code>public</code>. To mark something as private, you
use the keyword <code>private</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="modules">Modules</h1>

<ul>
<li>You can import a module with the keyword <code>require</code> (as in Perl) and the
name of the module in quotes.</li>
<li>One example of a module is the <code>benchmark</code> module, which provides the
<code>Benchmark</code> class, which has the method <code>.realtime</code>, which takes a block
and reports how much time it used.</li>
<li>To create a module, use a syntax similar to that of a class, but
substituting the keyword <code>class</code> with <code>module</code>.</li>
<li>The scope resolution operator in Ruby is the double colon (<code>::</code>), like in
Perl.</li>
<li><p>To create a method inside a module, you have to prefix it by the name of
the module with a dot or with <code>self.</code>, if you want to create a method to
be called outside the module.</p>

<p>The same also holds for creating class methods (as opposed to <em>instance</em>
methods): they can be simply named <code>self.foo</code> to get a class method called
<code>foo</code>.</p></li>
<li>While some modules are already "preloaded" by the interpreter (e.g.,
<code>Math</code>), others need to be explicitly loaded. We do this by using <code>require
'foo'</code> to load the module (in the file <code>foo</code>?).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="mixins">Mixins</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>A mixin is the use of a module to "enrich" a class, adding "instance"
methods of the module to the class.</p>

<p>It is, in a sense, a way to have some of multiple inheritance in Ruby
(without its headaches?)</p></li>
<li>Using the word <code>include Foo</code> imports the items of the module <code>Foo</code> in the
current namespace for <em>instances</em> of a class.</li>
<li>Using the word <code>extend Foo</code> imports the items of the module <code>Foo</code> in the
current namespace as class methods/attributes.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conventions">Conventions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Local variables are named in lower case, with parts separated by
underscores, as in <code>my_name</code>.</li>
<li>Methods that return boolean values have a question mark (<code>?</code>) at the end
of their name.</li>
<li>Methods that have destructive side-effects (like changing their input)
have an exclamation mark (<code>!</code>) at the end of their name.</li>
<li>Code is indented by 2 spaces.</li>
<li>Like other languages, constants are written in all caps, with words
separated by underscores. For example, <code>MAX_VALUE</code>.</li>
<li>Global variables are prefixed with a dollar sign (e.g., <code>&#036;Foo</code>).</li>
<li>Classes are named in camel case (no initial lowercase).</li>
<li>The "poetic mode" in Ruby recommends one to omit the parentheses on
function calls (whenever unambiguous) and, in essence, to write as little
"bureaucracy" (like the explicit <code>return</code> keyword in methods).</li>
</ul>
