	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;I just had my hands on some mobile devices (a Samsung&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_S_8.4&quot;&gt;Galaxy Tab S 8.4&quot;&lt;/a&gt;,
an Apple&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini_3&quot;&gt;iPad mini 3&lt;/a&gt;, and my no-name tablet that runs Android).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got curious to see how the different browsers identify themselves to the
world via their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%20agent&quot;&gt;User agent&lt;/a&gt; strings and I must say that each
browser&#39;s string reveals a lot about both the browser makers and their
philosophies regarding user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a simple table that I compiled with the information that I
collected (sorry if it gets too wide):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;col /&gt;
&lt;col /&gt;
&lt;col /&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;th&gt;Device&lt;/th&gt;
	&lt;th&gt;Browser&lt;/th&gt;
	&lt;th&gt;User-Agent String&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Samsung Galaxy Tab S&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Firefox 35.0&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Android; Tablet; rv:35.0) Gecko/35.0 Firefox/35.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Samsung Galaxy Tab S&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Firefox 35.0.1&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Android; Tablet; rv:35.0.1) Gecko/35.0.1 Firefox/35.0.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Samsung Galaxy Tab S&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Android&#39;s 4.4.2 stock browser&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 4.4.2; en-gb; SAMSUNG SM-T700 Build/KOT49H) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/1.5 Chrome/28.0.1500.94 Safari/537.36&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Samsung Galaxy Tab S&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Updated Chrome&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 4.4.2; SM-T700 Build/KOT49H) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.109 Safari/537.36&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Vanilla tablet&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Android&#39;s 4.1.1 stock browser&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 4.1.1; en-us; TB1010 Build/JRO03H) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/534.30&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Vanilla tablet&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Firefox 35.0.1&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Android; Tablet; rv:35.0.1) Gecko/35.0.1 Firefox/35.0.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;iPad&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Safari&#39;s from iOS 8.1.3&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; CPU OS 8_1_3 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/600.1.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/8.0 Mobile/12B466 Safari/600.1.4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Notebook&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Debian&#39;s Iceweasel 35.0.1&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0 Iceweasel/35.0.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Moto G4 Plus&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Firefox Focus 2.2&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Focus/2.2 Chrome/61.0.3163.98 Mobile Safari/537.36&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, briefly looking at the table above, you can tell that the stock Android
browser reveals quite a bit of information: the model of the device (e.g.,
&lt;code&gt;SAMSUNG SM-T700&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;TB1010&lt;/code&gt;) and even the build number (e.g.,
&lt;code&gt;Build/KOT49H&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Build/JRO03H&lt;/code&gt;)!  This is super handy for malicious
websites and I would say that it leaks a lot of possibly undesired
information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPad is similar, with Safari revealing the version of the iOS that it is
running.  It doesn&#39;t reveal, though, the language that the user is using via
the UA string (it probably does via other HTTP fields).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/mobile/&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; is similar to the stock Android browser here, but, at least, it
doesn&#39;t reveal the language of the user. It does reveal the version of
Android, including the patch-level (that&#39;s a bit too much, IMVHO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that the winner respecting privacy of the users among the
browsers that I tested is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/android/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;: it conveys just the bare minimum,
not differentiating from a high-end tablet (Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Tab S with 8
cores) and a vanilla tablet (with 2 cores).  Like Chrome, Firefox still
reveals a bit too much in the form of the patch-level. It should be
sufficient to say that it is version 35.0 even if the user has 35.0.1
installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bonus points with Firefox is that it is also available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://f-droid.org/&quot;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;, in
two versions: as &lt;a href=&quot;https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.mozilla.firefox&quot;&gt;Firefox itself&lt;/a&gt; and as &lt;a href=&quot;https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid&quot;&gt;Fennec&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit, 2017-10-19:&lt;/em&gt; Added the User-Agent string of Firefox Focus. Quite
different from regular Firefox, as we can see.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Holy moly! Things now seem to be going! I&#39;m quite happy with all
this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I clearead all the bugs in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://packages.debian.org/hfsprogs&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hfsprogs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://bugs.debian.org/436159&quot;&gt;very long standing bug&lt;/a&gt; in Apple&#39;s code
that prevented me from compiling everything in 64-bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the package compiles under all arches, which is amazingly great. I also
took the opportunity to &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.apple.com/archives/Darwin-userlevel/2009/Nov/msg00004.html&quot;&gt;tell
Apple&lt;/a&gt;
that I have patches that I want to push upstream. Let&#39;s see if they are
indeed open to collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m learning to use the marvellous
&lt;a href=&quot;http://packages.debian.org/quilt&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;quilt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to clean up some code of
others. With a bit of discipline, things get quite easy to work with. A
good tool can, indeed, make one&#39;s job much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, an TeXlive 2009 was &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; uploaded to experimental, which
means that it will soon reach unstable. I am already using it and
it is quite nice (actually, I&#39;ve been using it for a bit longer
than this, but the fact is that it is now available everywhere).
Thanks Norbert, Frank, Hilmar and Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On some other news, I am now maintaining &quot;my&quot; version of two nice
packages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amarok.kde.org/&quot;&gt;Amarok 1.4&lt;/a&gt;, which, although abandoned
upstream, is much more useful (and lighter on resources) than
Amarok 2. I have updated it with some patches and things are much
nicer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://packages.debian.org/grip&quot;&gt;grip&lt;/a&gt;, a very nice CD ripper,
which seems to be dead upstream, but which has some good patches
that are extremely easy to integrate. Coincidentally,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian-multimedia.org/&quot;&gt;Christian Marillat&lt;/a&gt; has, one
day after I started working on grip, packaged a version to put in
his repository. I think that we could join some forces maintaining
it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the biggest news of all: writing manpages is easier than
ever. I always edited Perl&#39;s pod files as a way to avoid writing
&lt;code&gt;*roff&lt;/code&gt; code directly and using the pod source to generate the
manpages. But I used Emacs&#39;s Perl mode. This way, Emacs shows the
pod source as a comment, without recognizing the structure of the
files. That&#39;s not a problem anymore. Russ Allbery just hinted me at
the fact that Emacs offers a pod-mode. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Since I maintain a Darwin partition on my system, I use
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-legacy.en.html&quot;&gt;GRUB legacy&lt;/a&gt;
to choose which OS I want to play with. But, then, due some of my
tweaking, it stopped working. Ouch. Even if I selected it, it
wouldn&#39;t boot and would return to GRUB&#39;s menu. Irritating, to say
the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being disappointed with that, I eventually,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/&quot;&gt;RTFM of GRUB&lt;/a&gt;
and learned a bit more about something that seems to give
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=107391&quot;&gt;hackintosh&lt;/a&gt;
users some headaches: the partition bootloader being foobared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solutions presented there are bizantine from a Unix P-o-V. The
necessary steps to fix it are just to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that the &lt;strong&gt;hard disk&lt;/strong&gt; bootloader (that is, the MBR
of your HD) contains GRUB&#39;s &lt;code&gt;stage 1&lt;/code&gt; loader.
&lt;em&gt;Warning:&lt;/em&gt; don&#39;t just &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; it to your HD&#39;s file, so that your
system can &quot;forget&quot; the partitions that you have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that the &lt;strong&gt;partition&lt;/strong&gt; bootloader (something that is
peculiar to the x86 arches and which, I as a user of other
platforms, didn&#39;t know that existed) is set to Apple&#39;s &lt;code&gt;boot1h&lt;/code&gt;.
This time, you can just &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; it to the first sector of the
partition where Darwin/MacOS X resides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach GRUB to set its snippet to run Darwin with
&lt;code&gt;root (hd0,0)&lt;/code&gt; (or whatever partition contains Darwin), tell it
to make the partition active with &lt;code&gt;makeactive&lt;/code&gt;, and tell it to load
the &lt;strong&gt;partition&lt;/strong&gt; bootloader with &lt;code&gt;chainloader +1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) Edit
&lt;code&gt;/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist&lt;/code&gt; to
contain the elements &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;Kernel&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;mach_kernel.foo&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to point to whatever is your
kernel of choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) If you make changes under Linux, with the &lt;code&gt;hfsplus&lt;/code&gt;
module, it is highly recommended that you unmount your filesystem
and run the &lt;code&gt;fsck.hfsplus&lt;/code&gt; from the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://packages.debian.org/hfsplus&quot;&gt;hfsplus&lt;/a&gt; package that I
maintain in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; (and which is mirrored
by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, but Debian&#39;s is more
up-to-date, as I have uploads rights there).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional)
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/testing-stuff-with-qemu-part-3-debian-gnu-kfreebsd&quot;&gt;Test it with QEMU&lt;/a&gt;,
to see if it will work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a nice learning exercise, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Much to my delight, I received today some nice people for my
birthday. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.binoklo.com/&quot;&gt;Adriano&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s presence was nice
(and I even had the opportunity to play with his last generation
iBook G4, and fix his keyboard), my Grandma, Jacob, Mom, Dad, Rose,
and Sa made a nice birthday party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, being with Adriano is always illuminating: I
learned about a book, about
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089457/&quot;&gt;a movie&lt;/a&gt;, about some MacOS X
programs that he runs, about some other concepts, about an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldofgoo.com/&quot;&gt;independent game&lt;/a&gt; that he supported
for MacOS X and so on. Always a pleasure to talk with him.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the &lt;code&gt;m3s.pl&lt;/code&gt; script made by Scott Lawrence, and given
the fact that he doesn&#39;t care anymore about it, I decided to see
what I could do so that I could generate MP3 CDs that will play
well with iTunes (like if they were regular audio CDs, but with
huge capacity and without connecting to the network to fetch
metadata).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the script could really gain some improvements
and that having it up to date has forced me to remember some Perl.
I made a lot of successful, incremental improvements by
encapsulating the code and making it reasonably readable (even with
a language that people say that is only &quot;writeable&quot;, but not
&quot;readable&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implemented things inserting data into a hash and then using the
name of the types of the fields that have to be in the
ContentsDB.xml file to write the appropriate values, but then I saw
that what I was doing was quite silly and implemented things in an
easier, cleaner way. Taking care to have things encoded in utf-8
and escaping the &amp;amp; character when writing the XML file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original program used the &lt;code&gt;MP3::Info&lt;/code&gt; module to gather
information about the songs. This module isn&#39;t as rich as the
&lt;code&gt;MP3::Tag&lt;/code&gt; module (which is able to get track numbers, track
counts, disc numbers, and disc counts, just off the top of my
head). This &quot;new&quot; module is quite good and more flexible and that&#39;s
what I adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, to traverse the directory tree, I am using &lt;code&gt;File::Find&lt;/code&gt;,
instead of a home-brew solution to the problem. There is only one
thing left for the script to be finished: having it write correctly
the &quot;numerical path&quot;, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; likes to
call it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, remembering things about references, compound data
structures, object orientation, the use of modules etc. has made me
gain some interest in Perl again. I think that I will make some
effort and learn it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I just submitted my third patch for the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/&quot;&gt;Linux kernel&lt;/a&gt;: it fixes the compilation
(and recognition) of the MTD device of the Kurobox HD that I have.
Now, I am running a brand new 2.6.29-rc6 kernel (yes, yes, it is
brand new right now, but at the breakneck pace with which the
kernel is moving, it will soon be quite outdated; I will try to
keep the powerpc part of things in shape, though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last, but not least, was the fact that I was submitted to a
biopsy (the original idea was for it to be just a colonoscopy, but
I had some inflammatory process in my elbows and some material had
to be removed for analysis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t really think that I am finished with all these health
things, but I surely made some improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I lied when I said that the biopsy thing was the last one that
I would write about. I am in the process of compressing movies with
the help of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://divxenc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;divxenc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://xvidenc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xvidenc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://h264enc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;h264enc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; scripts to generate
videos that are appropriate for playing in some set top boxes
&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; getting smaller files (which means that I will make my
small NAS last a little bit longer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since I discovered how to register myself on the iTunes music
store, I am downloading some German Podcasts. Will I be able to
learn some German? Well, I dearly hope so. My only grief is that I
am desperately running out of space and I will have to rethink my
backup strategy to leave some room for things to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I also played a little with MacOS X Tiger on Intel and the fact
that my e100 card didn&#39;t work with Tiger out-of-the box. I had to
use a special kernel extension for this very purpose. The only
thing that annoys me a lot is that I can trigger kernel panics with
the JaS kernel 10.4.8 in a deterministic manner. Upgrading the
kernel to 10.4.10 made my system not mount some disk images (and
even &quot;real&quot; disks, like my iPod video). I should, perhaps, try
Leopard here to see how things are structured and to see the
changes that Apple has provided to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding some cutting-edge programs, I saw that some programs were
removed from Debian after the release of lenny, since upstream is
inactive or dead. Too bad. But the nice side of things is that
snapshot.debian.net is a terrific service to the community and I&#39;ve
compiled things from there and got excellent results. I think that
I may even create a non-official repository with some multimedia
programs (and this includes, say, a newer, multithreaded version of
mplayer and newer libraries). I think that I will submit some more
bugreports (like the Real Video files from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aduni.org/&quot;&gt;ArsDigita University&lt;/a&gt; that
can&#39;t be played).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one last thing: (this one is really the last thing that I will
comment now) is that I finally will re-record my audio (and video)
things on digital media, so that I can preserve it without the loss
of magnetic media. This is a time-consuming activity, but I think
that it is worth the effort, especially if I use an automated setup
like Audacity&#39;s noise removal tool. Or is it better to use sox for
this task? I guess that I will have to experiment a little.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Apple&#39;s iTunes has a very cool feature that I would like to have and that I
still have not yet noticed in any of the Linux music players (be them
rhythmbox, amarok, quodlibet, audacious etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feature is the following: Apple&#39;s iTunes player has the possibility of
playing CD-DA, with the information about the tracks (in computer jargon,
metadata) taken from on-line databases like Gracenote&#39;s CDDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Free Software that I use doesn&#39;t have problems with this, at least
regarding audio CDs. They check some free on-line databases (like gnudb.org
or freedb.org, which, by the way, have CDs in their catalog that aren&#39;t
available in the commercial CDDB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the nicest feature that iTunes has is the ability to burn MP3/AAC CDs
taken from playlists composed by the user, neatly organized in a filesystem
structure of the format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;artist&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;album&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;song&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also generates an XML file with the contents of the MP3 CD in a way that
makes it playable just like a CD-DA, but with remarkable characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it doesn&#39;t need a connection to the Internet to grab metadata (which is,
of course, stored both in the XML file and in some file&#39;s metadata). This
means that no network connection is necessary to have information about
songs and the XML file acts like a cache to avoid the program reading the
whole CD to show the information in a user-friendly fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the MP3 CD is treated like a CD-DA, but with a much longer capacity (say,
12 hours, depending on the bitrate of the songs and their lengths).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the songs don&#39;t have to be imported into playlists and not even queued for
playing. Just selecting the first song to be played is enough for it to
start plaing things (and, of course, it is not always that we want to
import songs to our library).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I think that this would be a great thing for the GNOME
Desktop (and for others too), since it would increase the interoperability
with other Operating Systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only iTunes can create such CDs, but it can also create DVDs containing
MP3/AAC files, which, of course, means that the capacity of such &quot;CDs&quot; is
huge compared to that of usual audio CDs and it is also a convenient way to
carry the discs around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience and workflow, it would be really nice to be able to play
such CDs/DVDs with rhythmbox/amarok/quodlibet, as it would represent both a
handy feature and a nice interoperability factor (and convenience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Free Software players, more formats could be considered, of
course, than just MP3 and Low Complexity AAC. Vorbis, Speex, MP2, AC-3 and
other less-known formats would be possible (well, even Window&#39;s WMA files,
as they are playable by a lot of set-top boxes and car players).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, in addition to playing such CDs/DVDs, those programs could also create
such CDs (say, by passing the responsibility to another program), then
everything would be a dream come true and many other friends of mine would
be one step further from being tied to Mac OS X or Windows and closer to
Free Software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that this shows to be an improvement for the Free Software Desktop
environments like GNOME and KDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.: The same thing applies to Photo CDs created by iPhoto. It would be
really exciting to have them be recognized by F-Spot or other similar Photo
organizers.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Being the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free%20Software&quot;&gt;Free Software&lt;/a&gt; advocate that I am, I want to use as
much Free Software as I can (and spread the world).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: no, I don&#39;t like to call what I use
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%20Source&quot;&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.  I prefer the things the RMS way and if you
don&#39;t like the fact that I like his way, I&#39;m afraid that you may miss some
of the things that I have here, even if you don&#39;t necessarily agree with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I would like to use, see etc., the material that is available
on the Internet, that people has put available for others to see. In
particular, many Universities around the world are making the shift of being
only in the classroom to being present in their students&#39; lifes all the
time. This is accomplished by putting their educational material available
on-line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade or two ago, this was usually accomplished by publishing the
so-called &quot;lecture notes&quot; on the website of the course and maintaining
mailing-lists with the currently enrolled students. The lecture notes were
usually taken using the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe&quot;&gt;Scribe&lt;/a&gt; method&quot;, where, for each
class, one student is responsible of taking notes of the material, writing
it in a &quot;finished&quot; form and distributing it back for all the other
students. This was made in a round-robin fashion, as a means to spread the
responsibilities among the students taking the course. Also, the most common
tool used to edit the material, especially in Mathematically-oriented
courses, was to typeset everything in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX&quot;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; (or even plain
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX&quot;&gt;TeX&lt;/a&gt;, in some cases).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lecturer frequently distributed a template, which the students used and,
this way, all the notes written by the students had the same, uniform look
and style. The work was usually revised by the lecturer and, many times, it
resulted in a kind of a book, published in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device%5Findependent%5Ffile%5Fformat&quot;&gt;DVI&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript&quot;&gt;PostScript&lt;/a&gt; form (latter, it became common to use
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable%5Fdocument%5Fformat&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;, as it is a format more
popular).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, it is still quite frequent (and welcome!) to produce such lecture
notes. But, now, things have changed slightly. (I could discuss &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; things
have changed the way they have, but it is beyond the scope of these short
notes here.) People have been recording lectures in audio and, after the
technology became more accessible, in video. Now, a new term is used for
distributing those contents: &lt;em&gt;podcasting&lt;/em&gt;. Essentially, a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/podcast&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; is a way of publishing, say, audio so that people can
subscribe to your &quot;podcast&quot; (sometimes also said to be a &quot;channel&quot;). It is
very much like a radio program, where people tune in to listen to a given
program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way most people use to distribute the &quot;episodes&quot; of such
programs/podcasts is actually a combination of technologies, but nothing
exactly new: the description of &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is available is given in a format
called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; (which is a specialization of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt;,
but this isn&#39;t important for our subject matter) and the content is usually
in form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3&quot;&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt; files (or some variation of that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, enough background. Now, there are on-line stores on the Internet that
make available podcasts. Those podcasts are usually free of charge for the
listener. Some of the most prominent stores nowadays are
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%5FInc%2E&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &quot;iTunes Store&quot; and Amazon&#39;s store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has created its &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iTunes%20Store&quot;&gt;iTunes Store&lt;/a&gt;&quot; to foster the use of its
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iTunes&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; program and to boost the sales of its
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iPod&quot;&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; digital players (and, also, to make some extra money).
But people in the education field have seen that using a podcast would be a
good way of sharing knowledge and Apple wouldn&#39;t loose this market: they
invented the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes%5FStore%23iTunes%5FU&quot;&gt;iTunes U&lt;/a&gt;, which is
a way for Universities around the world to publish their content on &quot;iTunes
Store&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several big Universities have been putting their content on Apple&#39;s
iTunes-U. And, to see the directory of podcasts on iTunes-U, you have (in
theory) to use Apple&#39;s proprietary program iTunes, only available for
proprietary platforms: for Microsoft&#39;s Windows and for Apple&#39;s own
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac%20OS%20X&quot;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;. No Free Software alternative is officially
supported, despite the fact that the blurb on the Universities pages say
that only the access to the content has to be via iTunes and that the
content can be used with any MP3 player or with programs other than
iTunes. Yes, this means that the content is playable under
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and Linux plays a big role in higher education
environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, isn&#39;t there a way to access the blogs avoiding the use of proprietary
software? What about people that only want to use Free Software solutions
or, not even a matter of desiring to use Free Software, having only access
to Free Software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there is. Apple has changed the way that people use to get the
contents from its iTunes store during time, but, now, it seems to be quite
easy to grab it under a 100% Free environment. I have used this recipe for
two Universities only so far, but it has worked perfectly well. The
Universities in question are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT&quot;&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford%20University&quot;&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s say that you come across a link with the format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;itms://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/mit.edu.1330383747.01330383754.1330693646
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a link is &lt;em&gt;usually not&lt;/em&gt; recognized by browsers without the help of
extra software. In platforms where iTunes is available, the browser sends it
to iTunes and iTunes takes the duty of connecting to the &quot;iTunes Music
Store&quot; (that&#39;s where the &quot;itms&quot; thing at the beginning of the URL comes
from, by the way). Pay close attention to the part
&lt;code&gt;mit.edu.1330383747.01330383754.1330693646&lt;/code&gt;. That is the important part of
the URL here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is quite easy to convert the link above to something that can be
grabbed with a usual browser or, say, a program like wget or curl. Just
write the link as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/DownloadTracksFile/mit.edu.1330383747.01330383754.1330693646.mp4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The part up to and including &lt;code&gt;DownloadTracksFile/&lt;/code&gt; is constant. Only the
part after it is changed and taken from the original link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another way of rewriting the link. Its format is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/FeedEnclosure/mit.edu.1330383747.01330383754.1330693646/enclosure.mp4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the middle part of this URL is the actual part that we alluded
to. The rest is simply a constant thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this way, we can get the contents of podcasts with Free Software in an
automated way. That is, until Apple changes its scheme of doing things. But,
by that time, we will already have the things we want and newer solutions
can be devised soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&#39;s fire those wget&#39;s and start to study things (or prozilla&#39;s,
aria2c&#39;s etc, for some speed boost).&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Had some programming session on working with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://packages.debian.org/hfsprogs&quot;&gt;hfsprogs&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s packaging for
Debian. I finally saw how to build a multi-arch building and
introduced some cruft to compile it under amd64 (aka,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64&quot;&gt;x86-64&lt;/a&gt;), since
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s code is
&lt;a href=&quot;http://bugs.debian.org/436159&quot;&gt;not 64-bit clean&lt;/a&gt;. Ugh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s because they have the guts to show us their source code.
Imagine what a disaster it is to see proprietary software that is
completely closed!&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Upgraded my parent&#39;s computer from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s Feisty (7.10) to Hardy (8.04).
Now, some of the things that I&#39;m used to when using
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s sid are available on their
computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I can&#39;t avoid to use this opportunity to complain once more
about my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flash.net.br/&quot;&gt;ISP&lt;/a&gt;. If I weren&#39;t doing the
upgrade &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; early in the morning, I wouldn&#39;t have success,
as I am (right now), without signal from them. These outages are
getting on my nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some math related news, I finally saw a proof of the intuitive
fact the determinant of a 2x2 matrix is the signed area of the
parallelogram with vectors given by the column vectors of the
matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, my D-Link G122 (I think that that&#39;s the model) doesn&#39;t work
with the &lt;code&gt;rt2500usb&lt;/code&gt; driver that ships with the distribution: I can
see that &lt;code&gt;iwconfig&lt;/code&gt; lists &lt;code&gt;wlan0&lt;/code&gt; as having wireless extensions, I
can set the device, it can see the access point, I can enter the
WEP key, but it doesn&#39;t seem to get a DHCP lease from the router.
&lt;code&gt;:-(&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Spent some time polishing my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;
package for &lt;a href=&quot;http://cr.yp.to/&quot;&gt;qmail&lt;/a&gt;, with the patches managed by
quilt. Now, everything is more maintainable, despite the fact that
separating one monolithic patch into smaller patches was a pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally got some time to experience
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.org/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s latest distribution on my iBook.
Unfortunately, there seems to be serious problems with the live CD
as X isn&#39;t working correctly. &lt;code&gt;:-(&lt;/code&gt;. I still don&#39;t know what could
be the cause, since the framebuffer was set at 1024x768, but X
insisted on the resolution being 800x600.&lt;/p&gt;
