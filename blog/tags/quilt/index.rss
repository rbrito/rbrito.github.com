	<description>&lt;p&gt;These are some short notes on what I&#39;ve doing these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there isn&#39;t much to talk about. I think that one of the most
relevant things that I did was to resurrect one of my best
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital%5Faudio%5Fextraction&quot;&gt;audio-extracting&lt;/a&gt; CD-ROM
drives: just opened the case of my computer, took off the CD drive, opened,
cleaned its lens, lubricated the moving parts and everything is back to
normal operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sense of &quot;getting something for nothing&quot; is hard to explain to those
who have not experienced it already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things that I did was to grab some old CDs that I had laying here
(Radiohead&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK%20Computer&quot;&gt;OK Computer&lt;/a&gt;, Pantera&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far%5FBeyond%5FDriven&quot;&gt;Far Beyond Driven&lt;/a&gt;, the tribute to Queen called &quot;Dragon
Attack&quot;, and Gentle Giant&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free%20Hand&quot;&gt;Free Hand&lt;/a&gt;, among others). Dream
Theater&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic%5FChaos&quot;&gt;Special Edition of Systematic Chaos&lt;/a&gt;
is quite good, but unfortunately I don&#39;t have a 5.1 system at my disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also selected some material for further studies. I&#39;m right now studying
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/group%20actions&quot;&gt;group actions&lt;/a&gt; (or G-sets as some seem to prefer). Soon, I
will be finishing the basics of Group Theory (hey, really, why is the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugacy%20class&quot;&gt;Class Equation&lt;/a&gt; of groups that
&quot;famous&quot;? It is just a matter of saying that !!mathjaxbegin-i!! fFh8ID0gXHN1bV97eFxpbiBYfSAx
 !!mathjaxend-i!!, but
with cardinality of orbits instead of with one&#39;s and with a transversal of
the orbits in place of !!mathjaxbegin-i!! WA==
 !!mathjaxend-i!! itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, if the orbits of the elements of the !!mathjaxbegin-i!! Rw==
 !!mathjaxend-i!!-set !!mathjaxbegin-i!! WA==
 !!mathjaxend-i!! consist of just
one element, then the equation above is the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group%20action&quot;&gt;Class Equation&lt;/a&gt; (what some people would
call !!mathjaxbegin-i!! XG1hdGhvcHtcbWF0aHJte0ZpeH19KFgp
 !!mathjaxend-i!!, I would call the &quot;orbits being trivial&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s%20lemma&quot;&gt;Burnside&#39;s lemma&lt;/a&gt; (which actually seems to be wrongly
attributed, since it seems to be discovered independently by Cauchy and
Frobenius) for counting orbits of a given action of a !!mathjaxbegin-i!! Rw==
 !!mathjaxend-i!!-set has nice
implications in combinatorics and it should be, at least, mentioned in any
self-respecting introduction to Group Theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I almost forgot one of the major things that I did today (2007-06-12): I
finally learned how to manipulate the &lt;a href=&quot;http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;quilt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; patch-system (initiated
by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew%20Morton%20%28computer%20programmer%29&quot;&gt;Andrew Morton&lt;/a&gt;).
The crucial point that is not written anywhere: the patches, by default, are
applied with &lt;code&gt;-p1&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;-p0&lt;/code&gt;. This took me quite some time to get, as
the documentation isn&#39;t explicit about it. Installation of quilt in a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&quot;&gt;MacOS X&lt;/a&gt; system is not trivial, due to the demand of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/&quot;&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt; tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I can keep some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; packages of mine in a better shape than
if I were just applying a single monolithic patch.&lt;/p&gt;
