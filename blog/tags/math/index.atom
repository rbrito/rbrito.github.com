	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;h1 id=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, it&#39;s not Debian planet that has problems to deal with MathJax
(which makes posts usingn it appear illegible on Debian planet), but the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbrito/ikiwiki-plugin-mathjax&quot;&gt;ikiwiki plugin&lt;/a&gt; that I am using which generates garbage in the feeds
that get consumed by planet.debian.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you it know of a better plugin (which doesn&#39;t generate such output)
please let me know, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if it is not super computationally
expensive for a Core 2 Duo T7250 (which is my notebook).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;therealthing&quot;&gt;The real thing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://wstein.org/&quot;&gt;William Stein&lt;/a&gt; is now offering a course on Number Theory and he has
been posting recorded videos of his lectures, I started watching some of
them (mainly, the ones regarding continued factions).  In particular, he
shows the usual recursive formula for convergents of a continued fraction
and that&#39;s super nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the curious reader, the recurrence relations for the convergents of
!!mathjaxbegin-i!! W2FfMCwgYV8xLCBcbGRvdHMsIGFfbiwgXGxkb3RzXQ==
 !!mathjaxend-i!! are:
!!mathjaxbegin-d!! CnBfbiA9IGFfbiBwX3tuLTF9ICsgcF97bi0yfVxcCnFfbiA9IGFfbiBxX3tuLTF9ICsgcV97bi0y
fSwK
 !!mathjaxend-d!! with initial conditions (!!mathjaxbegin-i!! cF97LTJ9ID0gMA==
 !!mathjaxend-i!!, !!mathjaxbegin-i!! cF97LTF9ID0gMQ==
 !!mathjaxend-i!!, !!mathjaxbegin-i!! cF8wID0gYV8w
 !!mathjaxend-i!!,
!!mathjaxbegin-i!! cV97LTJ9ID0gMQ==
 !!mathjaxend-i!!, !!mathjaxbegin-i!! cV97LTF9ID0gMA==
 !!mathjaxend-i!!, !!mathjaxbegin-i!! cV8wID0gMQ==
 !!mathjaxend-i!!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He even motivated the use of continued fractions with the golden ratio,
which is super nice, given that I like the subject and have been writing a
document collecting facts that I know about the Fibonacci numbers (well,
this document is horribly incomplete and not even close to something that I
would consider proper for public consumption&amp;mdash;I plan on publishing
them soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, after he discussed the basics of it convergents, he noted that the
recurrence relations are like those defining the Fibonacci numbers, just
that one of the terms is &quot;weighted&quot; by the coefficients of the continued
fraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I missed one thing, though: neither &lt;a href=&quot;http://wstein.org/ent/&quot;&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt; nor wikipedia&#39;s article on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continued%20fractions&quot;&gt;continued fractions&lt;/a&gt; mentions a very neat, alternative way to
express the convergents of continued fractions (truth be said, I took a
quick peek at wikipedia&#39;s article and I found that it doesn&#39;t mentionat
least explicitly, in a 1 min skim&amp;mdash;it may well be buried somewhere
else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, then, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/115360165819500279592/posts/guGv6w9jmxr&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; the following exercise for his students (which he
apparently liked, as he +1&#39;s the suggestion):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prove that the recurrence relation of the !!mathjaxbegin-i!! cF9p
 !!mathjaxend-i!!&#39;s and !!mathjaxbegin-i!! cV9p
 !!mathjaxend-i!!&#39;s that we
mentioned before can be obtained via matrix multiplication. More precisely,
prove that:
!!mathjaxbegin-d!! ClxiZWdpbntibWF0cml4fQphXzAgJmFtcDsgMVxcCjEgJmFtcDsgMApcZW5ke2JtYXRyaXh9Clxi
ZWdpbntibWF0cml4fQphXzEgJmFtcDsgMVxcCjEgJmFtcDsgMApcZW5ke2JtYXRyaXh9ClxjZG90
cwpcYmVnaW57Ym1hdHJpeH0KYV9uICZhbXA7IDFcXAoxICZhbXA7IDAKXGVuZHtibWF0cml4fQog
PQpcYmVnaW57Ym1hdHJpeH0KcF9uICZhbXA7IHBfe24tMX1cXApxX24gJmFtcDsgcV97bi0xfQpc
ZW5ke2JtYXRyaXh9Lgo=
 !!mathjaxend-d!!
As a corollary, derive Cassini&#39;s identity for the Fibonacci Numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, if you any errors on this, please let me know so that I can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks &quot;noone&quot; for spotting a typographical error.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know how Debian planet deals with MathJax (it seems to
become illegible), but I will try to post this, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact:&lt;/strong&gt; Since the harmonic numbers can be approximated by the
natural logarithm, that is, !!mathjaxbegin-i!! SF9uIFxzaW1lcSBcbG4gbg==
 !!mathjaxend-i!!, we can clearly
see that
!!mathjaxbegin-d!! CiBcZnJhY3sxfXtpKzF9ICsgXGNkb3RzICsgXGZyYWN7MX17bn0gPSBIX24gLSBIX2kgXHNpbWVx
IFxsbiBuIC0gXGxuIGkgPSBcbG4gXGZyYWN7bn17aX0sCg==
 !!mathjaxend-d!!
which is a trivial approximation that may be handy sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you spot any errors on this, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Just a trivial fact: every polyhedron that is used in linear programming is
convex, that is !!mathjaxbegin-i!! QXggXGxlcSBi
 !!mathjaxend-i!! is convex, for a matrix !!mathjaxbegin-i!! QQ==
 !!mathjaxend-i!! and a (column)
vector !!mathjaxbegin-i!! Yg==
 !!mathjaxend-i!!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof:&lt;/strong&gt; Take any !!mathjaxbegin-i!! eCcsIHgnJw==
 !!mathjaxend-i!! that satisfy the system of inequalities !!mathjaxbegin-i!! QXggXGxlcSBi
 !!mathjaxend-i!!.
Then, for !!mathjaxbegin-i!! MCBcbGVxIFxsYW1iZGEgXGxlcSAx
 !!mathjaxend-i!!, we have that !!mathjaxbegin-i!! XGxhbWJkYSBBeCcgXGxlcSBcbGFtYmRhIGI=
 !!mathjaxend-i!!,
that is !!mathjaxbegin-i!! QSBcbGFtYmRhIHgnIFxsZXEgXGxhbWJkYSBi
 !!mathjaxend-i!!.  Similarly, for !!mathjaxbegin-i!! eCcn
 !!mathjaxend-i!!, we have
that !!mathjaxbegin-i!! QSAoMS1cbGFtYmRhKSB4JyBcbGVxICgxLVxsYW1iZGEpIGI=
 !!mathjaxend-i!!. Summing the inequalities, we
get:
!!mathjaxbegin-d!! CiBBW1xsYW1iZGEgeCcgKyAoMS1cbGFtYmRhKSB4JyddIFxsZXEgW1xsYW1iZGEgKyAoMS1cbGFt
YmRhKV0gYiA9IGIsCg==
 !!mathjaxend-d!!
which means that !!mathjaxbegin-i!! XGhhdHt4fSA9IFxsYW1iZGEgeCcgKyAoMS1cbGFtYmRhKSB4Jyc=
 !!mathjaxend-i!! is again a
solution of the original set of inequalities, thus concluding the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;These are some short notes on what I&#39;ve doing these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there isn&#39;t much to talk about. I think that one of the most
relevant things that I did was to resurrect one of my best
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital%5Faudio%5Fextraction&quot;&gt;audio-extracting&lt;/a&gt; CD-ROM
drives: just opened the case of my computer, took off the CD drive, opened,
cleaned its lens, lubricated the moving parts and everything is back to
normal operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sense of &quot;getting something for nothing&quot; is hard to explain to those
who have not experienced it already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things that I did was to grab some old CDs that I had laying here
(Radiohead&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK%20Computer&quot;&gt;OK Computer&lt;/a&gt;, Pantera&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far%5FBeyond%5FDriven&quot;&gt;Far Beyond Driven&lt;/a&gt;, the tribute to Queen called &quot;Dragon
Attack&quot;, and Gentle Giant&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free%20Hand&quot;&gt;Free Hand&lt;/a&gt;, among others). Dream
Theater&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic%5FChaos&quot;&gt;Special Edition of Systematic Chaos&lt;/a&gt;
is quite good, but unfortunately I don&#39;t have a 5.1 system at my disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also selected some material for further studies. I&#39;m right now studying
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/group%20actions&quot;&gt;group actions&lt;/a&gt; (or G-sets as some seem to prefer). Soon, I
will be finishing the basics of Group Theory (hey, really, why is the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugacy%20class&quot;&gt;Class Equation&lt;/a&gt; of groups that
&quot;famous&quot;? It is just a matter of saying that !!mathjaxbegin-i!! fFh8ID0gXHN1bV97eFxpbiBYfSAx
 !!mathjaxend-i!!, but
with cardinality of orbits instead of with one&#39;s and with a transversal of
the orbits in place of !!mathjaxbegin-i!! WA==
 !!mathjaxend-i!! itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, if the orbits of the elements of the !!mathjaxbegin-i!! Rw==
 !!mathjaxend-i!!-set !!mathjaxbegin-i!! WA==
 !!mathjaxend-i!! consist of just
one element, then the equation above is the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group%20action&quot;&gt;Class Equation&lt;/a&gt; (what some people would
call !!mathjaxbegin-i!! XG1hdGhvcHtcbWF0aHJte0ZpeH19KFgp
 !!mathjaxend-i!!, I would call the &quot;orbits being trivial&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s%20lemma&quot;&gt;Burnside&#39;s lemma&lt;/a&gt; (which actually seems to be wrongly
attributed, since it seems to be discovered independently by Cauchy and
Frobenius) for counting orbits of a given action of a !!mathjaxbegin-i!! Rw==
 !!mathjaxend-i!!-set has nice
implications in combinatorics and it should be, at least, mentioned in any
self-respecting introduction to Group Theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I almost forgot one of the major things that I did today (2007-06-12): I
finally learned how to manipulate the &lt;a href=&quot;http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;quilt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; patch-system (initiated
by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew%20Morton%20%28computer%20programmer%29&quot;&gt;Andrew Morton&lt;/a&gt;).
The crucial point that is not written anywhere: the patches, by default, are
applied with &lt;code&gt;-p1&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;-p0&lt;/code&gt;. This took me quite some time to get, as
the documentation isn&#39;t explicit about it. Installation of quilt in a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&quot;&gt;MacOS X&lt;/a&gt; system is not trivial, due to the demand of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/&quot;&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt; tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I can keep some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; packages of mine in a better shape than
if I were just applying a single monolithic patch.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;It is not a surprise for anyone that I&#39;m reviewing a little bit of Abstract
Algebra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading Fraleigh&#39;s book is proving to be quite a good refresher, especially
since my short-term goal is to study &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding%20Theory&quot;&gt;Coding Theory&lt;/a&gt; and the
finer aspects of Coding Theory do involve Algebra (actually, one could say
that the finer aspects of Coding Theory, especially Error Correcting Codes,
depend quite a lot on Algebra).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, while studying Group Theory, one can&#39;t avoid to be amazed by some
results that are not exactly that intuitive. For instance, I just discovered
that the additive group !!mathjaxbegin-i!! XG1hdGhiYiBaW1hd
 !!mathjaxend-i!! of univariate polynomials with
integer coefficients is isomorphic to the multiplicative group !!mathjaxbegin-i!! XG1hdGhiYiBRXis=
 !!mathjaxend-i!!
of positive rationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that this was a relatively easy exercise until I posed the problem
to a very competent friend of mine and he had some problems trying to come
up with the isomorphism. His failure maybe tells me that this is not as
obvious as I once thought and I think that this exercise should be better
known, as it can show that very differently looking algebraic structures can
be &quot;the same&quot; and the most surprising fact here is that &lt;em&gt;we are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;
dealing with any pathologically &quot;made up&quot; example&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that maybe is hard for students to grasp is the concept of a
factor group. Knowing that a subgroup is normal iff it is the kernel of some
homomorphism of groups is a handy way to memorize and &quot;see&quot; what a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/normal%20subgroup&quot;&gt;normal subgroup&lt;/a&gt; is. And students should be shown that there
are some quite special (&quot;natural&quot;?) normal subgroups of a group: the &lt;em&gt;center
of the group&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;commutator subgroup&lt;/em&gt;, just as two examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter one, together with a good explanation of what does it mean for
taking &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient%20group&quot;&gt;factor groups&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., taking the
elements of the normal subgroup and equating them to the unity), leads to a
better understanding of quotient/factor groups. A nice thing to prove (that
is short and shows the &quot;mechanics&quot; of factor groups) is the fact that a
quotient group is abelian iff the normal group used as the &quot;denominator&quot;
contains the commutator subgroup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that is worth doing is proving that a normal subgroup !!mathjaxbegin-i!! Tg==
 !!mathjaxend-i!! is
maximal in a group !!mathjaxbegin-i!! Rw==
 !!mathjaxend-i!! iff !!mathjaxbegin-i!! Ry9O
 !!mathjaxend-i!! is simple. The proof of this fact is
analogous to the proof of the quotient of a ring being a field iff a ring is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor%20ring&quot;&gt;factored&lt;/a&gt; by a maximal ideal (and that we
get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/integral%20domain&quot;&gt;integral domain&lt;/a&gt; if the ideal is only prime instead of
maximal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, two groups that I feel that should merit way more attention than what
I perceive as being given in a first course are the dihedral groups !!mathjaxbegin-i!! RF8z
 !!mathjaxend-i!!
and !!mathjaxbegin-i!! RF80
 !!mathjaxend-i!!. Asking the students to draw the lattice of subgroups of such
groups is quite enlightening, as they are &quot;natural&quot; groups that are not
abelian (but with &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the proper subgroups being abelian). Nice examples
to have in mind, without any shadow of doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>On teaching Groups before Rings in Abstract Algebra</title>

	<published>2007-04-22T20:46:52Z</published>


	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking about how one should teach &lt;a
href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra&quot;&gt;Abstract Algebra&lt;/a&gt;
and it seems to me that John B. Fraleigh&#39;s book &quot;A First Course in Abstract
Algebra&quot; is exactly what I would write if I confidently knew the subject and
if the book were not written yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;strong&gt;there is&lt;/strong&gt; room for improvement (and I think that I may have
alternative proofs; in fact, I&#39;m fond of multiple different proofs for a
given fact, as they shed a different light on the matter being discussed)
and I would change some demonstrations or condense some of them, but the
general outline of the book is superb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the choice (and order) of subjects is quite adequate, contrary
to many people that think that students should be exposed to &lt;a
href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28mathematics%29&quot;&gt;Rings&lt;/a&gt; before
being exposed to &lt;a
href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_%28mathematics%29&quot;&gt;Groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, I think that, to foster the abstract thinking of students
that may not yet have the so-called &quot;mathematical maturity&quot;, one should give
them &quot;poor&quot; algebraic structures (satisfying just a few axioms) and then
deducing things almost &quot;mechanically&quot;. This &quot;mechanic thinking&quot; and &quot;dealing
with the unknown&quot; is quite important to dissociate the meaning that students
are used to assign to objects that they already know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, what is the &quot;fun&quot; (or even the motivation) of proving that 1
is greater than 0 on the integers? The students, quite correctly, assert
that this is &quot;obviously true&quot;, for they can &quot;draw&quot;, say, a ball on a sheet
of paper and no ball on another an say that &lt;em&gt;indeed&lt;/em&gt;, given their
intuitive knowledge of what an order relation is, that there is no need to
prove anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only when presented with structures where this is not true is that one would
appreciate the fact that there exists an example of an infinite integral
domain (with unique factorization, which is also not to take for granted!)
is that the proof of such a fact is perceived to be important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, if &quot;everything is normal&quot;, one could think that &quot;intuitive&quot; facts
are indeed true and even disregard the necessity of proofs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning an abstract algebra book for freshmen or sophomores that had only
&quot;computational&quot; courses on Calculus up to that point (what an unfortunate
fact!) with a discussion of groups and spending a good amount of time with
proofs on elementary facts, leads the students to develop the frequently
cited prerequisite &quot;mathematical maturity&quot; needed for understanding anything
non-trivial that needs a good amount of abstraction (and this includes the
&lt;strong&gt;proper&lt;/strong&gt; programming of computers, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should not be interpreted as an attack on texts that cover rings before
groups (or weaker structures). It just means that I think that, as a
pedagogical tool, using rings first may not be as &quot;eye-opening&quot; (for the
abstract world, and, therefore, for &lt;em&gt;Real Mathematics&lt;/em&gt;) as other
approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is completely understadable for a graduate (or even advanced
undergraduate) text to provide a &quot;fresh&quot; view on Rings (and the pathological
cases &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be included), say, by giving, as motivation, the problem
of writing primes as sums of two squares (which can be viewed as a problem
of factorization on the Gaussian Integers integral domain).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that other instructors actually read this and stop to think about the
possibilities, even if they don&#39;t agree with my views (just causing thought
is enough for me).&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;One good thing to have in mind is that when one is minimally
serious about data structures, then on covering the topic of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table&quot;&gt;hash tables&lt;/a&gt;, it is a
quite good chance to talk about the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox&quot;&gt;&quot;birthday paradox&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.
In the analogy, each day would correspond to a slot in the hash
table and each person would correspond to an item to be inserted
into the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one takes this into account, the analysis of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox#Collision_counting&quot;&gt;collisions&lt;/a&gt;
is meaninful from a probabilistic point of view, which matters a
lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the subject a little, in a replacement that lasted, say,
15 minutes (tops), the cable modem is back again working, which
means that playing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://lartc.org/&quot;&gt;tunneling&lt;/a&gt; under
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; (especially, using the IPSec
interface) is back again a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it seems that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntulinux.org&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases&quot;&gt;dapper&lt;/a&gt; is &quot;mom proof&quot;.
Well, at least, she has been learning to use it with some hiccups,
but, then, personal computers aren&#39;t things with which she plays
everyday. She was surprised to know about
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.org/&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and its broad coverage. And,
indeed, it is superb.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Just finished reading neat and combinatorial proofs of &quot;Fermat&#39;s
Little Theorem&quot; and &quot;Wilson&#39;s Theorem&quot; (although only in one
direction) in George E. Andrews&#39;s &quot;Number Theory&quot; book from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doverpublications.com&quot;&gt;Dover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this seems to be an elementary book on Number Theory (it
covers just the basics---which I have been trying to learn for some
time now) it is also &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; well-written. Perhaps some writers of
computer books could learn a thing or two with Mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;I had the &quot;midterm&quot; today. I thought that while the subjects
covered were well chosen, it was not very well planned regarding
time. I mean, only 1h40min for all those proofs? A comfortable
period would be, say, 3h or 4h, but, then, maybe I&#39;m a
perfectionist. Maybe I&#39;m slow. Maybe both.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I&#39;ll have the &quot;midterm&quot; of Combinatorial Optimization.
It&#39;s not exactly a midterm, since it is considerably skewed towards
the end of the semester and I&#39;ll have 3 other tests until the
course is finished, but I guess that having this many tests is
actually better than having only two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m terribly tired, sad (I&#39;m not emotionally very well) and without
much motivation to study for my test. I have a reasonbly good grasp
of the theory, but some details of the subject didn&#39;t &quot;sink in&quot; up
till now and I&#39;m not very much optimistic regarding what I can do
until tomorrow. In particular, finding negative cycles efficiently
(i.e., in polynomial time) is still a mystery for me. I have some
intuition of why the O(nm) algorithm works, but I have still to sit
down and write a complete, detailed a proof. I wish I had time.&lt;/p&gt;
