	&lt;p&gt;I guess that I should really take some time to experiment with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openbsd.org&quot;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;. If not for anything else, it
seems that the system is so well documented that I found a site
pointed by their FAQ with an on-line engine that generated a
Modeline for whooping 1024x768 @85Hz with the Trident card. I had
never really pushed my monitor that far. On the low side, it seems
the Trident card is made by some RIAA people and just generates
some noise when I&#39;m playing some MP3s. Looking forward to see if X4
can help me with acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Oh, my! I stayed up to 7am without any sleep to get the card to do
just a sucky 1024x768x16bits with a similarly bad refresh rate. And
the card is sloooow. Or so it seems. But
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; tells me other people are also
having problems with it, which makes me a little bit more
comfortable (at least I&#39;m not going nuts thinking that I&#39;m
consistently making stupid mistakes -- which are more common than
what I&#39;d like to admit).&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Took the day to go to my uncle&#39;s computer shop and installed
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org&quot;&gt;Debian GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; Potato (which is a beta
release with final release quality) for him with Helix Code&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.helixcode.com&quot;&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;. This is the n-th attempt at
converting him to see the light, but, for some reason, it appears
that he was not as scared as in the previous attempts. Since my
trustworthy S3 Trio64+ is giving signals of its age, I got a newer
Tridend 3DImage750 to substitute it.&lt;/p&gt;
