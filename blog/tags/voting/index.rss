	<description>&lt;p&gt;Today is election day again (the city where I live had a second
turn of elections) and surprisingly computers have helped again. I
thought the only thing they did was take our free time. It took me
less than one minute to vote and I didn&#39;t stand in line for hours.
Something must be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also kept downloading more things from Napster. And my 13GB HD is
almost completely full. I guess that I&#39;m obessed with broadband.&lt;/p&gt;
