	<description>&lt;p&gt;Seeing now that the situation regarding Free fonts is much better than in
the past, I have started packaging some that are of high enough quality so
that we can have it available on our systems (be it Debian or any of the
good derivatives).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I spent some time during the past few days &lt;a href=&quot;https://launchpad.net/~rbrito/+archive/ppa/&quot;&gt;packaging&lt;/a&gt;
some that, I think, deserve to be mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paratype.com/public/&quot;&gt;ParaType Sans&lt;/a&gt;: this typeface family consists of a set of proportional,
sans-serif fonts that supply a lot of Cyrillic glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: the intention of this font is that of supporting many of the
smaller ethnic and cultural aspects present in Russia. It was even funded
by the Russian Government: in particular, by the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Agency_on_Press_and_Mass_Communications&quot;&gt;Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you should care&lt;/strong&gt;: for those (like me) that use a Latin-based
alphabet, the fonts also have some nice attractives, like, besides the
usual 4 shape/weight combinations (regular, italic, bold, bold italic),
two other variants: PT Sans Narrow (with its respective bold) and PT Sans
Caption (also with bold).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the fonts support ligatures (liga, dlig), fractions
(frac), ordinals (ordn), and glyph composition (ccmp), among &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt;
OpenType features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymouspro.html&quot;&gt;Anonymous Pro&lt;/a&gt;: this typeface family consists of a set of fixed-width
fonts with the usual 4 shape/weight combinations (regular, italic, bold,
bold italic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: Anonymous Pro was made with people that stare at a computer
screen, coding for long amounts of time, or people that use a terminal all
the time.  Apart from being scalable, it also features some pre-made
bitmap versions at some sizes (10, 11, 12, and 13), so that they should
look better than some automatically drawn font without proper
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting&quot;&gt;TrueType hinting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My package still is not good enough, as I have not yet included explicit
support for the bitmapped sizes via some fontconfig configuration, but I
expect to fix those in two or three days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This should just be a matter of including something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;edit name=&quot;embeddedbitmap&quot; mode=&quot;assign&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;bool&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/bool&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/edit&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the configuration that I ship with the fonts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html&quot;&gt;Cardo&lt;/a&gt;: this is produced by David Perry and it is a proportional,
serif, old-style typeface similar to some highly regarded fonts like
Bembo. It does not offer italic, or bold versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: Cardo&#39;s target &quot;audience&quot; are scholars that need to type set
Medieval texts, it has &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; glyphs, support for many opentype features
and the author has told me that he may even provide some support for
typesetting Mathematics (and this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a very big deal, since typesetting
Mathematics is hard enough when you decide to change your typefaces).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works quite well with Jonathan Kew&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripts.sil.org/xetex&quot;&gt;XeTeX&lt;/a&gt; and you should just try
it, especially if you are into serif fonts (like I am).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.droidfonts.com/droidfonts/&quot;&gt;Droid&lt;/a&gt;: this consists of three font families, with varying shapes and
weights, in sans-serif, sans-serif monospaced, and serif families.  It has
received a lot of press, due to it being sponsored by Google and made by
Ascender Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: the Droid fonts were made for Google&#39;s Android platform and
one of the main concerns was to be readable on devices with low resolution
(like computer screens). It has a very wide coverage of glyphs (as one
would expect from a font for phones) and have very high quality. A really
nice donation to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://linuxlibertine.sf.net/&quot;&gt;Linux Libertine&lt;/a&gt;: this has to be one of the most beautiful fonts that
I have see in a while. It has the basic four combinations of a serif font&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: to provide a beautiful, &quot;organic&quot; version of a typeface that
can substitute Times/Times New Roman. It works well both with &quot;regular&quot;
latex/pdflatex and with XeTeX (and, quite probably, with LuaTeX). It has
quite a lot of OpenType features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rbrito:~&amp;#036; otfinfo -f /usr/share/fonts/truetype/linux-libertine/LinLibertine_Re.ttf | wc -l
25
rbrito:~&amp;#036;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I can&#39;t be impartial with this font. It is beautiful. It is a pity
that we are in a feature freeze and that a the new version
&lt;a href=&quot;http://bugs.debian.org/602845#10&quot;&gt;won&#39;t probably be included in squeeze&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/evristika/&quot;&gt;Heuristica (&quot;Эвристика&quot;)&lt;/a&gt;: since Adobe has &lt;a href=&quot;http://tug.org/fonts/utopia/LICENSE-utopia.txt&quot;&gt;donated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_%28typeface%29&quot;&gt;Utopia&lt;/a&gt;
to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tug.org/&quot;&gt;TeX Users&#39;s Group&lt;/a&gt; under a Free Software license, it was only
a matter of time that people would tweak them and generate other versions.
Then comes Andrey Panov&#39;s Heuristica, a modified version of the four basic
typefaces that Adobe donated, in OpenType format (and, to boot, some
&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/font-helpers/&quot;&gt;nice scripts for fontforge&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: Heuristica improves Utopia with the primary intent of adding
Cyrillic symbols by Andrey V. Panov. Andrey has also incorporated
Vietnamese glyphs made available by Hàn Thế Thành. Heuristica is a family
that features regular and italic shapes, with both being present also in
bold weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that&#39;s it for now. Stay tuned for more to come.&lt;/p&gt;
