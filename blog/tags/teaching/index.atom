	&lt;p&gt;Some amazing new packages are coming into Debian&#39;s testing
distribution. What a great time to live using Free Software only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I &quot;bribed&quot; Alexandre to get him to see one of my classes,
where covered recursion and the Towers of Hanoi Problem. &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//tags/teaching/../../smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:-)&quot; /&gt; He
told me that the class was &quot;unusual&quot;. I have yet to ask him what
exactly about it was unusual, but it seems that he thought that it
wasn&#39;t bad. &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//tags/teaching/../../smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:-)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Ok, so, I am almost giving up the hectic mess in which work has
turned to... I need to take a serious time resting a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m so tired and people are so demanding of me and of my creativity
that its hard to even take some time with pleasant things. For
instance, in the little time that I have to sleep, I don&#39;t have the
motivation to study the neat things that I always wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that this means that I&#39;m overworked, without any shadow of
doubt. Being sleepy while at work has never been a common thing for
me, even when I was in the tiring days of my M.Sc. studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, in those days, I thought that I was progressing (and it&#39;s
hard not to feel you&#39;re progressing when you&#39;re being pushed to
your limits), but now, with little time for intellectual
challenges, I see little point in keeping up with the work I&#39;m
doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not particularly exciting to be teaching how to write a for
for the 20th time in less than two years. I guess that if the
concept of iteration doesn&#39;t enter one&#39;s brain as soon as it is
told, then all is hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that I need a significant other to make everything bright
(even those less-than-perfect moments). Someone that truly
understands what I mean, what my ideals are, what my values are and
how I see the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, yes, I am willing to even change some things of me. But please
don&#39;t disillusion me. In some sense, I&#39;m fragile. Even more than
most people think that I am. Despite the tough cover that I may
have, lies a friendly person. Truly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has released a bunch
of new stuff, with the highlight (for me, at least), being the new
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&quot;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Came back to work and it was actually a surprise to see the classes
so full of students. I guess that I have been hitting them somewhat
hard, but they should be prepared for the challenges of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also pleased to know that I will be working with competent
people being my assistants.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Oh, My! This semester has been a long and tiring one. Still had
work to do and it wasn&#39;t nice. But now, I guess that I will have
more spare time to do things that I want.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;I hate midterms. I hate finals. I hate preparing them. I hate
scoring them. I have to discover an easier way to evaluate my
student&#39;s acquired abilities without something as painful as
scoring those tests.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Started the new Summer Course on Topics on Programming. A great
opportunity to get the things &quot;the right way&quot; and put an
introduction on Mathematical Induction, on Recursion and on
Algorithm/Loop Invariants, since they aren&#39;t covered in details for
novices in any of the books that I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&#39;m &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; going thru heaps of mid-terms. They never seem to

	&lt;p&gt;I discovered that maybe I slightly more popular than I thought. &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//tags/teaching/../../smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:-)&quot; /&gt;
I even have
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=642523&quot;&gt;the honour(?) of having an orkut community&lt;/a&gt;
dedicated to me. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Today I got myself a new bootleg, from Opeth&#39;s current tour. I
haven&#39;t had time to actually listen to it, but it sounds good so
far (obviously, it is just an audience recording -- no soundboard
quality expected).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also took away some
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fenix.usp.br/&quot;&gt;bureacratic requirements&lt;/a&gt; regarding my
course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today is my students&#39; &quot;mid-term&quot;. Let&#39;s see how they fare at
that.&lt;/p&gt;
