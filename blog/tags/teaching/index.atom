	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;One good thing to have in mind is that when one is minimally
serious about data structures, then on covering the topic of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table&quot;&gt;hash tables&lt;/a&gt;, it is a
quite good chance to talk about the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox&quot;&gt;&quot;birthday paradox&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.
In the analogy, each day would correspond to a slot in the hash
table and each person would correspond to an item to be inserted
into the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one takes this into account, the analysis of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox#Collision_counting&quot;&gt;collisions&lt;/a&gt;
is meaninful from a probabilistic point of view, which matters a
lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the subject a little, in a replacement that lasted, say,
15 minutes (tops), the cable modem is back again working, which
means that playing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://lartc.org/&quot;&gt;tunneling&lt;/a&gt; under
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; (especially, using the IPSec
interface) is back again a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it seems that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntulinux.org&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases&quot;&gt;dapper&lt;/a&gt; is &quot;mom proof&quot;.
Well, at least, she has been learning to use it with some hiccups,
but, then, personal computers aren&#39;t things with which she plays
everyday. She was surprised to know about
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.org/&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and its broad coverage. And,
indeed, it is superb.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Learning a bit more regarding photography in general. For instance,
now I know the difference between
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storyphoto.com/journalism/phototip_nine.html&quot;&gt;Slow Synchro&lt;/a&gt; (&quot;nighttime&quot;)&lt;/em&gt;
and
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storyphoto.com/journalism/phototip_five.html&quot;&gt;Fill&lt;/a&gt; (&quot;forced&quot;)&lt;/em&gt;
flash. It will be nice to be able to use them both when the
situations arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A student of mine has lent me his &quot;Towers of Hanoi&quot; puzzle so that
I can teach recursion for some students. The fact that recursion
works so well for some cases seems to be surprising (like
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/&quot;&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; or wizardry, sometimes) for
some students. They are not used to simple and elegant solutions to
some problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much, Victor!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Got sick and went to the hospital. Unfortunately, I could&#39;t go to
work. This has possibly messed with my schedule, but what exactly
could I do? I&#39;m voiceless and the medications that I took gave me
allergic reactions. These times have been a bit unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still have to go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/&quot;&gt;IME&lt;/a&gt; to study Abstract
Algebra (in an undergraduate level, but who cares?), get the last
parcel of my payment and the finals of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/~rbrito/verao/2006&quot;&gt;the Summer Course&lt;/a&gt;
(which I have to grade soon).&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Back to &quot;school&quot;. The classes on &quot;Design of Algorithms&quot; will be my
playground this semester, together with the classes on
&quot;Introduction to Compilers&quot;. Let&#39;s see how the experiment turns out
to be.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Trying to catch up with most of the things that I still have to do.
Sleeping well was one of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And tomorrow is my student&#39;s midterm. I hope that they find the
test challenging while, at the same time, informative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CWEB implementation of my Gauss Integers class in C++ with
computation of quotient and remainder is getting cleaner. But I&#39;d
still like to implement it in a better &quot;literate style&quot; and use the
&quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; trick to have better use of data encapsulation.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Mostly a futile day. Well, not entirely lost, because I put a new
quiz for the

	&lt;p&gt;Some amazing new packages are coming into Debian&#39;s testing
distribution. What a great time to live using Free Software only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I &quot;bribed&quot; Alexandre to get him to see one of my classes,
where covered recursion and the Towers of Hanoi Problem. &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:-)&quot; /&gt; He
told me that the class was &quot;unusual&quot;. I have yet to ask him what
exactly about it was unusual, but it seems that he thought that it
wasn&#39;t bad. &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:-)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Ok, so, I am almost giving up the hectic mess in which work has
turned to... I need to take a serious time resting a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m so tired and people are so demanding of me and of my creativity
that its hard to even take some time with pleasant things. For
instance, in the little time that I have to sleep, I don&#39;t have the
motivation to study the neat things that I always wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that this means that I&#39;m overworked, without any shadow of
doubt. Being sleepy while at work has never been a common thing for
me, even when I was in the tiring days of my M.Sc. studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, in those days, I thought that I was progressing (and it&#39;s
hard not to feel you&#39;re progressing when you&#39;re being pushed to
your limits), but now, with little time for intellectual
challenges, I see little point in keeping up with the work I&#39;m
doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not particularly exciting to be teaching how to write a for
for the 20th time in less than two years. I guess that if the
concept of iteration doesn&#39;t enter one&#39;s brain as soon as it is
told, then all is hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that I need a significant other to make everything bright
(even those less-than-perfect moments). Someone that truly
understands what I mean, what my ideals are, what my values are and
how I see the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, yes, I am willing to even change some things of me. But please
don&#39;t disillusion me. In some sense, I&#39;m fragile. Even more than
most people think that I am. Despite the tough cover that I may
have, lies a friendly person. Truly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has released a bunch
of new stuff, with the highlight (for me, at least), being the new
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&quot;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Came back to work and it was actually a surprise to see the classes
so full of students. I guess that I have been hitting them somewhat
hard, but they should be prepared for the challenges of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also pleased to know that I will be working with competent
people being my assistants.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Oh, My! This semester has been a long and tiring one. Still had
work to do and it wasn&#39;t nice. But now, I guess that I will have
more spare time to do things that I want.&lt;/p&gt;
