	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tried to go to my university, to see a seminar on the Steiner
Problem in Graphs, without success (the traffic didn&#39;t let me
arrive). Came back home and decided that it would be nice to visit
my uncle&#39;s store. He was leaving early to catch the last hours of
this year&#39;s Comdex and I went with him (he gave me an pass).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its always nice to see all those exposition stands &quot;competing&quot; to
see which one has got the prettiest models. And it was also nice to
see that flat panels are invading the market, but I wonder how much
time it will take before they are &quot;purchaseable&quot;, especially for a
graduate student.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;[[!mathjax ]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learned today that the &quot;Four Russians&#39; Method&quot; applied to dynamic
programming is able to achieve a complexity of !!mathjaxbegin-i!! TyhuXjIvXGxvZyBuKQ==
 !!mathjaxend-i!!, which
is a theoretical improvement over the classic dynamic programming
method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would guess that a person from a distant country can make you
happier than most people from your own country?&lt;/p&gt;
