	<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I finally got the Power Macintosh 9500/180MP with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian testing&lt;/a&gt; installed in a semi-decent
way: I&#39;m using BenH&#39;s 2.4.17-ben0 kernel which finally has the mace
driver working again. What does this mean? Well, it means that I&#39;m
now not confined to 2.2.x kernels anymore. A 2.4 kernel has many
advantages, especially, for the PowerPC platform. Among other
things, they are faster for the same hardware, have good SMP
support, the IMSTT pci card is recognized (which wasn&#39;t in the 2.2
kernels) and a lot of other nice goodies like a journalling
filesystem (ext3) etc.
Also got &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3/&quot;&gt;lame 3.90.1&lt;/a&gt; compiled for the
PowerPC in a decent way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collateral effect of having lame compiled for the ppc is that now
I have a have a good benchmark that shows me roughly how much
slower this thing is in relation to my Duron 600MHz. The sad news:
it is 5 or 6 times slower than the Duron. If lame were
multithreaded, then it could be up to 2.5 times slower, which would
be acceptable for day-to-day use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, got some work done to make the Debian packaging
scripts a bit nicer (read: closer to being lintian clean).
Unfortunately, lintian still complains about the shared library
package having an rpath and I don&#39;t know how to get rid of that
(not even a kludgy solution).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://mplayer.sf.net&quot;&gt;MPlayer&lt;/a&gt; released another version
(0.60pre2), I downloaded the sources and, to my surprise, it
compiles on PPC (the 0.60pre1 didn&#39;t). And it even plays, errr,
tries to play DivX movies! Amazing job these guys are
accomplishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After struggling a lot with the configuration files, also got X
4.1.0 working on a framebuffer device (the imstt driver doesn&#39;t
work). So, now I even have a reasonably fast, modest GUI working
(or a slower GUI if I load &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/&quot;&gt;KDE 2&lt;/a&gt;). And I can
even use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; here, although the
swapping doesn&#39;t make it a pleasant experience. In this respect,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opera.com/&quot;&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt;, while non-free, is much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this can now be a poor&#39;s man desktop machine. If it
only consumed power proportional to its speed, it would be nicer.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m now mirroring both a repository of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://kde.tdyc.com&quot;&gt;Debian KDE packages&lt;/a&gt; for potato and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.helixcode.com&quot;&gt;Helix Gnome&lt;/a&gt; for Debian with rsync. It&#39;s
&lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; better than mirroring with wget, that&#39;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was expecting to go to the movies today, but due to some (ahem)
&quot;technical problems&quot;, I wasn&#39;t able to go. And this made me quite
sad, but that&#39;s not actually a problem. Perhaps next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repackaged &lt;a href=&quot;http://lame.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;LAME&lt;/a&gt; 3.87beta for
Debian/potato and it is lintian-clean (!). So far, it seems to be
good and I think that I&#39;ll post a message to debian-mentors asking
what could be improved. In fact, the only thing that I don&#39;t like
in my package is the fact that I&#39;ve hardcoded a Build-Depends:
libncurses5-dev line in the control file. That&#39;s not quite right,
IMO, and I&#39;ll learn how to change it soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next step is to package &lt;a href=&quot;http://cr.yp.to/djb.html&quot;&gt;DJB&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
utilities qmail, ucspi-tcp, serialmail and checkpassword. The
former seems to be quite involved, but the latters seem to be
trivial enough to package in one afternoon only (am I optimistic or
what?) and then I&#39;ll be able to switch to my brand new computer
(MICROS\~1 free) with Debian 2.2 + KDE 2.2 + my local packages (I
still won&#39;t have XFree86 4.0.1 and all its nifty features, since
I&#39;ll be waiting for a version of it to be compiled for potato;
using woody is scary).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another package that I may be interested in packaging is a
ftpparse-ified version of wget (for mirroring
&lt;a href=&quot;http://cr.yp.to/publicfile.html&quot;&gt;publicfile&lt;/a&gt; repositories).&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;My aunt&#39;s birthday today. Tried to call her, but who said it would
be possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that a customer of mine that was giving me headaches when
I tried to receive for a job that I did for him (interconnecting
his computers with other places) finally gave up avoiding to pay
me. Nothing like a good threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/~lymber/&quot;&gt;best friends&lt;/a&gt; (if not
the best) lent me some Vivaldi and I&#39;ve ripped everything and
encoded with a version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sulaco.org/mp3/&quot;&gt;LAME&lt;/a&gt; that
I&#39;ve packaged for Debian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/~jose/&quot;&gt;advisor&lt;/a&gt; and I decided that we
should start with my research. Now I need a subject.&lt;/p&gt;
