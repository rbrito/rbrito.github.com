	<description>&lt;p&gt;After waking up at 2pm, I found myself pondering if I should or not
go to McDonald&#39;s to get those 10 Big Macs that mom had bought for
Mc Dia Feliz. I went and then, after being stuffed, went again to
my uncle&#39;s shop. I brought him my comp and he made a cool hack to
change my computer&#39;s battery. My computer seems happier and
healthier. Ok, not sure about happier, but it sure looks healthier.
And just found out that my uncle had a cool, brand-new
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.speedy.com.br&quot;&gt;ADSL&lt;/a&gt; installed in his office. Wow!
Those things kick some major ass! Downloading MP3s faster than I
can play them. It&#39;s officially a Good Thing(tm).&lt;/p&gt;
