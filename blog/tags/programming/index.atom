	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;h1 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/sicp.html&quot;&gt;not alone&lt;/a&gt; in considering &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold%20Abelson&quot;&gt;Harold Abelson&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald%20Jay%20Sussman&quot;&gt;Gerald Jay Sussman&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/&quot;&gt;recorded lectures&lt;/a&gt; based on their
book &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html&quot;&gt;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is a
masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many things to like about the content of the lectures, beginning
with some pearls and wisdom about the craft of writing software (even though
this is not really a &quot;software enginneering&quot; book), the clarity with which
the concepts are described, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/&quot;&gt;Freedom-friendly&lt;/a&gt; aspects of the authors
regarding the material that they produced and much, the breadth of the
subjects covered and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;thevideostheirlengthandsplittingthem&quot;&gt;The videos, their length, and splitting them&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course consists of 20 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE18841CABEA24090&quot;&gt;video files&lt;/a&gt; and they are all uploaded on
Youtube already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one thing, though: while the lectures are naturally divided into
segments (the instructors took a break in after every 30 minutes or so worth
of lectures), the videos corresponding to each lecture have all the segments
concatenated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better watch them, accounting for the easier possibility to put a few of
the lectures in a mobile device or to avoid fast forwarding long videos from
my NAS when I am watching them on my TV (and some other factors), I decided
to sit down, take notes for each video of where the breaks where, and write
a simple Python script to help split the videos in segments, and, then,
reencode the segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided not to take the videos from Youtube to perform my splitting
activities, but, instead, to operate on one of the &quot;sources&quot; that the
authors once had in their homepage (videos encoded in DivX and audio in
MP3).  The videos are still available as a torrent file (with a magnet link
for the hash &lt;a href=&quot;magnet:?xt=urn:btih:650704e4439d7857a33fe4e32bcfdc2cb1db34db&quot;&gt;650704e4439d7857a33fe4e32bcfdc2cb1db34db&lt;/a&gt;), with some
very good souls still seeding it (I can seed it too, if desired).  Alas, I
have not found a source for the higher quality MPEG1 videos, but I think
that the videos are legible enough to avoid bothering with a larger
download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon found out that there are some beneficial side-effects of splitting
the videos, like not having to edit/equalize the entire audio of the videos
when only a segment was bad (which is understandable, as these lectures were
recorded almost 30 years ago and technology was not as advanced as things
are today).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, since I already have the split videos lying around here, I figured out
that, perhaps, other people may want to download them, as they may be more
convenient to watch (say, during commutes or whatever/whenever/wherever it
best suits them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, uploading all the videos is going to take a while and I would
only do it if people would really benefit from them.  If you think so, let
me know here (or if you know someone who would like the split version of the
videos, spread the word).&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>A version of xpdf with the poppler backend available</title>

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Well, it&#39;s been some time since I last wrote here and things are quite
hectic, due to some real-life happenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;announcement&quot;&gt;Announcement&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those people that are insterested in a &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; PDF viewer, based on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://poppler.freedesktop.org/&quot;&gt;an actively maintained backend&lt;/a&gt;, and that
&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost/blog/2010/05/27/please-let-me-zoom-my-documents/&quot;&gt;doesn&#39;t bring your computer to a halt&lt;/a&gt; when you try to zoom your
documents when you need to see some details, then you might want to give
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/rbrito/xpdf-poppler&quot;&gt;this version of xpdf&lt;/a&gt; a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already received some reports for some bugs and fixed them, with one of
them being a problem related by a kind user of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gentoo.org/&quot;&gt;Gentoo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people have asked me why this even needs to exist in the first place
and I agree that it would be better if it didn&#39;t: I would love to spend my
time actually &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; my computers rather than &lt;em&gt;fixing&lt;/em&gt; my computers for
better tasks (read: studying Mathematics, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upstream maintainer of xpdf uses it as one source of income and keeps it
running across many system (even legacy ones).  I &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt; that this one of
the reasons why he tries to keep xpdf almost self contained, with many parts
that could be delegated to other libraries, and with some abstraction code
that makes the code compile even in the presence of &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; broken compilers.
Of course, this means, in part, that as long as you take more duties,
maintaing the code becomes more and more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told me that he doesn&#39;t offer an open development tree because he wants
to give his customers some advantages over the public version and his
reasons are perfectly justifiable, of course.  He also manifested the
interest of possibly basing xpdf on a &quot;more modern toolkit&quot; and, when I
asked him what that would be, he mentioned that, perhaps, it would be
Qt. The development of xpdf will, quite probably, take newer directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, xpdf has not seen a new upstream release since
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/CHANGES&quot;&gt;2007-02-27&lt;/a&gt;.  It did, though, have &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-3.02pl1.patch&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-3.02pl2.patch&quot;&gt;patchlevel&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-3.02pl3.patch&quot;&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-3.02pl4.patch&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt;. Taking care of the maintainance of the code is a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://bugs.debian.org/527840&quot;&gt;high concern&lt;/a&gt; for distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people, though, would like to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle&quot;&gt;keep it simple&lt;/a&gt; (me included).
Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bugs.debian.org/351279&quot;&gt;some efforts&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2010/06/msg00046.html&quot;&gt;maintain&lt;/a&gt; it had &lt;a href=&quot;http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=289803&quot;&gt;not had&lt;/a&gt; the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2010/06/msg00068.html&quot;&gt;necessary coordination&lt;/a&gt; and duplication of effort has occured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;proposal&quot;&gt;Proposal&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am willing to become a patch aggregator for the code in xpdf with a
poppler backend. I would love to give it some refactoring too, drop some of
the legacy code that is not used (and only serves to make the code hard to
read), and adopt some good coding style standard (I particularly
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle&quot;&gt;like the one from the Linux Kernel&lt;/a&gt;---with the proper adaptations for
C++).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have already &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle&quot;&gt;contacted the people at Gentoo&lt;/a&gt;, and I would love to get
people from Fedora, Ubuntu, and Suse involved also. Alas, the last time I
tried to mail their mailing lists, I got messages telling me that my
messages were rejected or waiting for moderation, because I was not a
subscriber. I never heard back, since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate it if you could help spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Having been playing with some new things in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, like the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://packages.debian.org/magicfilter&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;magicfilter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package,
which is a superb, lightweight solution to all my printing
problems: to use a PCL 3 printer. I think that I will also
&quot;manufacture&quot; a solution with a metapackage of a live CD that
includes the environment that I use frequently, with the packages
that I use (this is probably quite leaner than what
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; has done with their distribution,
since I will mainly use some lighter packages).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, talking about lighter packages, I see that Debian has adopted a
new C library, namely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eglibc.org/&quot;&gt;EGLIBC&lt;/a&gt;, which
stands for Embedded LIBC. Finally, it seems that Debian will focus
a bit more on smaller systems (which is a good thing, because
computing resources are limited).&lt;/p&gt;

	<published>2009-03-03T03:00:00Z</published>


	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the &lt;code&gt;m3s.pl&lt;/code&gt; script made by Scott Lawrence, and given
the fact that he doesn&#39;t care anymore about it, I decided to see
what I could do so that I could generate MP3 CDs that will play
well with iTunes (like if they were regular audio CDs, but with
huge capacity and without connecting to the network to fetch
metadata).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the script could really gain some improvements
and that having it up to date has forced me to remember some Perl.
I made a lot of successful, incremental improvements by
encapsulating the code and making it reasonably readable (even with
a language that people say that is only &quot;writeable&quot;, but not
&quot;readable&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implemented things inserting data into a hash and then using the
name of the types of the fields that have to be in the
ContentsDB.xml file to write the appropriate values, but then I saw
that what I was doing was quite silly and implemented things in an
easier, cleaner way. Taking care to have things encoded in utf-8
and escaping the &amp;amp; character when writing the XML file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original program used the &lt;code&gt;MP3::Info&lt;/code&gt; module to gather
information about the songs. This module isn&#39;t as rich as the
&lt;code&gt;MP3::Tag&lt;/code&gt; module (which is able to get track numbers, track
counts, disc numbers, and disc counts, just off the top of my
head). This &quot;new&quot; module is quite good and more flexible and that&#39;s
what I adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, to traverse the directory tree, I am using &lt;code&gt;File::Find&lt;/code&gt;,
instead of a home-brew solution to the problem. There is only one
thing left for the script to be finished: having it write correctly
the &quot;numerical path&quot;, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; likes to
call it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, remembering things about references, compound data
structures, object orientation, the use of modules etc. has made me
gain some interest in Perl again. I think that I will make some
effort and learn it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I just submitted my third patch for the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/&quot;&gt;Linux kernel&lt;/a&gt;: it fixes the compilation
(and recognition) of the MTD device of the Kurobox HD that I have.
Now, I am running a brand new 2.6.29-rc6 kernel (yes, yes, it is
brand new right now, but at the breakneck pace with which the
kernel is moving, it will soon be quite outdated; I will try to
keep the powerpc part of things in shape, though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last, but not least, was the fact that I was submitted to a
biopsy (the original idea was for it to be just a colonoscopy, but
I had some inflammatory process in my elbows and some material had
to be removed for analysis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t really think that I am finished with all these health
things, but I surely made some improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I lied when I said that the biopsy thing was the last one that
I would write about. I am in the process of compressing movies with
the help of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://divxenc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;divxenc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://xvidenc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xvidenc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://h264enc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;h264enc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; scripts to generate
videos that are appropriate for playing in some set top boxes
&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; getting smaller files (which means that I will make my
small NAS last a little bit longer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since I discovered how to register myself on the iTunes music
store, I am downloading some German Podcasts. Will I be able to
learn some German? Well, I dearly hope so. My only grief is that I
am desperately running out of space and I will have to rethink my
backup strategy to leave some room for things to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I also played a little with MacOS X Tiger on Intel and the fact
that my e100 card didn&#39;t work with Tiger out-of-the box. I had to
use a special kernel extension for this very purpose. The only
thing that annoys me a lot is that I can trigger kernel panics with
the JaS kernel 10.4.8 in a deterministic manner. Upgrading the
kernel to 10.4.10 made my system not mount some disk images (and
even &quot;real&quot; disks, like my iPod video). I should, perhaps, try
Leopard here to see how things are structured and to see the
changes that Apple has provided to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding some cutting-edge programs, I saw that some programs were
removed from Debian after the release of lenny, since upstream is
inactive or dead. Too bad. But the nice side of things is that
snapshot.debian.net is a terrific service to the community and I&#39;ve
compiled things from there and got excellent results. I think that
I may even create a non-official repository with some multimedia
programs (and this includes, say, a newer, multithreaded version of
mplayer and newer libraries). I think that I will submit some more
bugreports (like the Real Video files from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aduni.org/&quot;&gt;ArsDigita University&lt;/a&gt; that
can&#39;t be played).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one last thing: (this one is really the last thing that I will
comment now) is that I finally will re-record my audio (and video)
things on digital media, so that I can preserve it without the loss
of magnetic media. This is a time-consuming activity, but I think
that it is worth the effort, especially if I use an automated setup
like Audacity&#39;s noise removal tool. Or is it better to use sox for
this task? I guess that I will have to experiment a little.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;I was quite surprised that I received
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/~pf/algoritmos-livro/&quot;&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; from a very,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/~pf/&quot;&gt;very dear Professor&lt;/a&gt; of mine. The book
is an introduction to the study of Analysis of Algorithms and it is
a pleasure to see a high-standard book (even if elementary) written
in Portuguese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the translations of books like Cormen&#39;s
&quot;Introduction to Algorithms&quot; are severely broken. They are not
really worth the price and I would even dare to say that they do a
disservice to the student that tries to learn from those books
(Cormen&#39;s one in particular---be warned that I&#39;m not talking here
about the original English edition, which is superb, but the
Brazilian Portuguese translation). There are many atrocities in the
translation like translating &quot;array&quot; to &quot;arranjo&quot;, while the usual,
correct choices would be &quot;vetor&quot; or &quot;matriz&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;There is an amazing discussion about compiler optimizations going
on right now at the lkml. It all began with Ingo Molnar&#39;s patches
to improve &lt;code&gt;.text&lt;/code&gt; size with GCC 4 compilers. Really quite
informative to see both the pros and cons of using the &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt;
keyword of the C compilers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way, while the discussion reached the consensus that
using &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; in abundance is a problem, it reminded me that
people should use &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; for functions that are meant to be used
only in the compilation unit where they appear. This way, GCC is
even able reduce the size of the generated binaries (not exactly
sure if this would impact the running size of the binaries---I
still have to investigate that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so tired today that I slept for about 16h. I needed that.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Wow! The good news have not stopped! Another amazing thing: the

&lt;a href=&quot;http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/&quot;&gt;also videos of the classes taught in 1986&lt;/a&gt;
by the authors themselves and they are definitely worth the
download.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Started the new Summer Course on Topics on Programming. A great
opportunity to get the things &quot;the right way&quot; and put an
introduction on Mathematical Induction, on Recursion and on
Algorithm/Loop Invariants, since they aren&#39;t covered in details for
novices in any of the books that I know.&lt;/p&gt;
