	&lt;p&gt;Well, it&#39;s been some time since I last wrote here and things are quite
hectic, due to some real-life happenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;announcement&quot;&gt;Announcement&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those people that are insterested in a &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; PDF viewer, based on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://poppler.freedesktop.org/&quot;&gt;an actively maintained backend&lt;/a&gt;, and that
&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost/blog/2010/05/27/please-let-me-zoom-my-documents/&quot;&gt;doesn&#39;t bring your computer to a halt&lt;/a&gt; when you try to zoom your
documents when you need to see some details, then you might want to give
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/rbrito/xpdf-poppler&quot;&gt;this version of xpdf&lt;/a&gt; a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already received some reports for some bugs and fixed them, with one of
them being a problem related by a kind user of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gentoo.org/&quot;&gt;Gentoo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people have asked me why this even needs to exist in the first place
and I agree that it would be better if it didn&#39;t: I would love to spend my
time actually &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; my computers rather than &lt;em&gt;fixing&lt;/em&gt; my computers for
better tasks (read: studying Mathematics, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upstream maintainer of xpdf uses it as one source of income and keeps it
running across many system (even legacy ones).  I &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt; that this one of
the reasons why he tries to keep xpdf almost self contained, with many parts
that could be delegated to other libraries, and with some abstraction code
that makes the code compile even in the presence of &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; broken compilers.
Of course, this means, in part, that as long as you take more duties,
maintaing the code becomes more and more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told me that he doesn&#39;t offer an open development tree because he wants
to give his customers some advantages over the public version and his
reasons are perfectly justifiable, of course.  He also manifested the
interest of possibly basing xpdf on a &quot;more modern toolkit&quot; and, when I
asked him what that would be, he mentioned that, perhaps, it would be
Qt. The development of xpdf will, quite probably, take newer directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, xpdf has not seen a new upstream release since
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/CHANGES&quot;&gt;2007-02-27&lt;/a&gt;.  It did, though, have &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-3.02pl1.patch&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-3.02pl2.patch&quot;&gt;patchlevel&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-3.02pl3.patch&quot;&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-3.02pl4.patch&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt;. Taking care of the maintainance of the code is a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://bugs.debian.org/527840&quot;&gt;high concern&lt;/a&gt; for distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people, though, would like to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle&quot;&gt;keep it simple&lt;/a&gt; (me included).
Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bugs.debian.org/351279&quot;&gt;some efforts&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2010/06/msg00046.html&quot;&gt;maintain&lt;/a&gt; it had &lt;a href=&quot;http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=289803&quot;&gt;not had&lt;/a&gt; the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2010/06/msg00068.html&quot;&gt;necessary coordination&lt;/a&gt; and duplication of effort has occured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;proposal&quot;&gt;Proposal&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am willing to become a patch aggregator for the code in xpdf with a
poppler backend. I would love to give it some refactoring too, drop some of
the legacy code that is not used (and only serves to make the code hard to
read), and adopt some good coding style standard (I particularly
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle&quot;&gt;like the one from the Linux Kernel&lt;/a&gt;---with the proper adaptations for
C++).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have already &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle&quot;&gt;contacted the people at Gentoo&lt;/a&gt;, and I would love to get
people from Fedora, Ubuntu, and Suse involved also. Alas, the last time I
tried to mail their mailing lists, I got messages telling me that my
messages were rejected or waiting for moderation, because I was not a
subscriber. I never heard back, since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate it if you could help spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;There is an amazing discussion about compiler optimizations going
on right now at the lkml. It all began with Ingo Molnar&#39;s patches
to improve &lt;code&gt;.text&lt;/code&gt; size with GCC 4 compilers. Really quite
informative to see both the pros and cons of using the &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt;
keyword of the C compilers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way, while the discussion reached the consensus that
using &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; in abundance is a problem, it reminded me that
people should use &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; for functions that are meant to be used
only in the compilation unit where they appear. This way, GCC is
even able reduce the size of the generated binaries (not exactly
sure if this would impact the running size of the binaries---I
still have to investigate that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so tired today that I slept for about 16h. I needed that.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Wow! The good news have not stopped! Another amazing thing: the
legendary book
&lt;em&gt;&quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot;&lt;/em&gt; by Hal
Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman is &lt;strong&gt;entirely&lt;/strong&gt;
available on-line at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html&quot;&gt;MIT Press Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but there are
&lt;a href=&quot;http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/&quot;&gt;also videos of the classes taught in 1986&lt;/a&gt;
by the authors themselves and they are definitely worth the
download.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Started the new Summer Course on Topics on Programming. A great
opportunity to get the things &quot;the right way&quot; and put an
introduction on Mathematical Induction, on Recursion and on
Algorithm/Loop Invariants, since they aren&#39;t covered in details for
novices in any of the books that I know.&lt;/p&gt;
