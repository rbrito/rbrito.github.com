	<description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/117659222649141007981/posts/T3BcxA7wKjK&quot;&gt;ZFS evaluation journey&lt;/a&gt; (which I will summarize here with
the things that I learned), I was able to fit about 2.5TB of data on a
single 2TB drive, with deduplication enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even &lt;em&gt;moving&lt;/em&gt; files around in ZFS (which you would think
would be a cheap operation) takes ages. Removing files also takes ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; unloaded Phenom II X4 910 system running Linux 3.5.2
(actually, from Debian&#39;s experimental), and zfsonlinux version
0.6.0.71-0ubuntu1~precise1 (recompiled from source to work with my Debian
system), I tried to remove a subdirectory that had about 4000
files. According to time, it took:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;real    42m51.487s
user    0m0.188s
sys     0m16.769s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is a bit too slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just (read: &quot;yesterday&quot;) upgraded this machine from 4GB to 6GB of RAM
(well, I would have updated it to 8GB of RAM as that is what I ordered, but
it one of the RAM chips arrived dead here and I simply took one of the new
4GB card and one of the older 2GB card).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, honestly, I don&#39;t see change in upgrading the RAM from 4GB to 6GB and,
unless something magic happens with 2GB more, I wouldn&#39;t expect a whole
different story with 8GB of RAM. Oh, no swap is being used (well, it is an
unloaded machine after all), and the Linux kernel swappiness knob is at its
default of 60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; see, though, is that even for a single file removal, the disk is
thrashing a lot. I mean &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; crazy and that is, of course, the prime
suspect of the bad performance (of course, of course). So, there must be
some really crazy metadata churning going on here and I guess that the
people from the LLNL would like to know of their modules producing this
behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep tuned for some future impressions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The nice thing today is that I have slept for 14 hours. I needed
that. And I still need yet another dose of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It stinks to see that
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ajato.com.br&quot;&gt;broadbrand providers&lt;/a&gt; don&#39;t know their
shit, when one asks them for it. When I asked them for some not so
standard technical details, the support got all confused (all of a
sudden the line becomes silent). Anyway, I could understand that
they don&#39;t provide me with a fixed IP (but what do they use? DHCP?
PPP-over-Ethernet?). I&#39;ve sent them an e-mail. I know that I&#39;ll
receive a &quot;canned&quot; answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reiserfs 3.5.25 is released and now I can upgrade my kernel to
2.2.17 with reiserfs and André&#39;s patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been listening to Vivaldi all day long today. Talking about
music, I want to order Agalloch&#39;s &quot;Pale Folklore&quot; from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theendrecords.com&quot;&gt;The End Record&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s on-line form, but
it seems that their shopping cart doesn&#39;t get anything included
when I select the album (am I using it correctly?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new Gnapster is released and now I can connect to the main
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.napster.com/&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt; server again. Woohoo.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, what a day! I&#39;m getting a bit older today. Some kind people
have sent me some cards (and some e-cards).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the day began that way, I was pleased to learn that my
September issue of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxjournal.com&quot;&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/a&gt;
arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, it was so nice to see a birthday present in form of a new
kernel (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linux.com&quot;&gt;Linux 2.2.17&lt;/a&gt;) being released.
Hopefully it will make the feedback and VM system a bit easier on
the user (now, I just need
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linux-ide.org&quot;&gt;André Hedrick&#39;s IDE&lt;/a&gt; patch and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://devlinux.net/namesys/&quot;&gt;Reiser FS&lt;/a&gt; ported to 2.2.17). And
there&#39;s the news that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org&quot;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; may be packaged to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, now that Qt is being dually
licensed, which is übercool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day is not over yet and I just got my glasses fixed and now I
can see the world much clearer. Uh... If all days were like
this...&lt;/p&gt;
