	<description>&lt;p&gt;It seems that dad is with a quite fragile health. I hope very
dearly that he has a better luck than my grandfather and doesn&#39;t
need a surgery (since we would all be scared of that, anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got the material for the first series of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/&quot;&gt;Deutsche Welle&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/dw/0,2142,2595,00.html&quot;&gt;&quot;Deutsch: Warum Nicht?&quot;&lt;/a&gt;
course (which I had already printed) bound. It will be much better
to follow the stories and exercises this way.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Got sick and went to the hospital. Unfortunately, I could&#39;t go to
work. This has possibly messed with my schedule, but what exactly
could I do? I&#39;m voiceless and the medications that I took gave me
allergic reactions. These times have been a bit unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still have to go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/&quot;&gt;IME&lt;/a&gt; to study Abstract
Algebra (in an undergraduate level, but who cares?), get the last
parcel of my payment and the finals of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/~rbrito/verao/2006&quot;&gt;the Summer Course&lt;/a&gt;
(which I have to grade soon).&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Due to the accident of yesterday, today I decided to take pictures
of my car, just as a proof of the damage made by mad freshmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine has kindly helped with her camera and taking
pictures of the car. They are just scary. I just get the feeling
that I am living among wild, savage people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a neighbour of mine has kindly lent me his
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samsung.com/&quot;&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samsungcamera.com/&quot;&gt;still camera&lt;/a&gt; for me to take some
extra pictures, before going to the police. It is a Digimax A302,
with capacity of 3.2 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that, now, the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macdevcenter.com/lpt/a/2849&quot;&gt;Top Ten Digital Photography Tips&lt;/a&gt;
will make more sense to me (along with reading the manual of the
camera). Oh, by the way, it worked fine with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.16-rc3.bz2&quot;&gt;2.6.16-rc3&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
mass storage module loaded. No extra drivers needed. Nice toy. And
a nice operating system too.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Got a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flash.net.br/&quot;&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; connection. It&#39;s
cable modem and the quality is variable. I&#39;m still evaluating it,
though. Some problems like reverse-DNS not properly configured
comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the DHCP connection is &quot;authenticated&quot; by the
MAC address of the card. When I showed that it was so easy to fake,
the cable guy didn&#39;t even believe what he saw. Is this bad news?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My car has almost turned junk due to vandalism of freshmen that
just got into the College. Poor souls. They don&#39;t know what to
expect when they take classes.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Back to &quot;school&quot;. The classes on &quot;Design of Algorithms&quot; will be my
playground this semester, together with the classes on
&quot;Introduction to Compilers&quot;. Let&#39;s see how the experiment turns out
to be.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, so, I am almost giving up the hectic mess in which work has
turned to... I need to take a serious time resting a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m so tired and people are so demanding of me and of my creativity
that its hard to even take some time with pleasant things. For
instance, in the little time that I have to sleep, I don&#39;t have the
motivation to study the neat things that I always wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that this means that I&#39;m overworked, without any shadow of
doubt. Being sleepy while at work has never been a common thing for
me, even when I was in the tiring days of my M.Sc. studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, in those days, I thought that I was progressing (and it&#39;s
hard not to feel you&#39;re progressing when you&#39;re being pushed to
your limits), but now, with little time for intellectual
challenges, I see little point in keeping up with the work I&#39;m
doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not particularly exciting to be teaching how to write a for
for the 20th time in less than two years. I guess that if the
concept of iteration doesn&#39;t enter one&#39;s brain as soon as it is
told, then all is hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that I need a significant other to make everything bright
(even those less-than-perfect moments). Someone that truly
understands what I mean, what my ideals are, what my values are and
how I see the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, yes, I am willing to even change some things of me. But please
don&#39;t disillusion me. In some sense, I&#39;m fragile. Even more than
most people think that I am. Despite the tough cover that I may
have, lies a friendly person. Truly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has released a bunch
of new stuff, with the highlight (for me, at least), being the new
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&quot;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Came back to work and it was actually a surprise to see the classes
so full of students. I guess that I have been hitting them somewhat
hard, but they should be prepared for the challenges of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also pleased to know that I will be working with competent
people being my assistants.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oh, My! This semester has been a long and tiring one. Still had
work to do and it wasn&#39;t nice. But now, I guess that I will have
more spare time to do things that I want.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It seems that soon I will have
&lt;a href=&quot;http://meusite.mackenzie.com.br/rbrito&quot;&gt;a new site&lt;/a&gt;, for putting
material for my students. Nice. I love (controlled) redundancy
regarding my data.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A busy day working -- lots of phone calls helping a customer to get
his Windows 2000 working correctly with IP routing. Then (on the
bright side), made the Linux boxes of another customer&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netlink.psi.br&quot;&gt;ISP&lt;/a&gt; work well with Radius
authentication services. Unfortunately, we could not test it, but
everything there looks good. We&#39;ll see tomorrow if there are any
complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/&quot;&gt;KDE 2.2.1&lt;/a&gt; was released today. That&#39;s
great, since it is a quite advanced Desktop Environment for Linux
available now and is way more polished than
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnome.org/&quot;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt; is, at least IMO. It will hit
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/releases/sid/&quot;&gt;sid&lt;/a&gt; in some days and soon
will be in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/releases/woody/&quot;&gt;woody&lt;/a&gt; (I
hope).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of new things in the Debian incoming repository: KDE 2.2.1,
KOffice 1.1, Broadcast 2000, dillo, and Java 1.3. Woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;
