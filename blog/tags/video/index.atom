	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;h1 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/sicp.html&quot;&gt;not alone&lt;/a&gt; in considering &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold%20Abelson&quot;&gt;Harold Abelson&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald%20Jay%20Sussman&quot;&gt;Gerald Jay Sussman&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/&quot;&gt;recorded lectures&lt;/a&gt; based on their
book &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html&quot;&gt;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is a
masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many things to like about the content of the lectures, beginning
with some pearls and wisdom about the craft of writing software (even though
this is not really a &quot;software enginneering&quot; book), the clarity with which
the concepts are described, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/&quot;&gt;Freedom-friendly&lt;/a&gt; aspects of the authors
regarding the material that they produced and much, the breadth of the
subjects covered and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;thevideostheirlengthandsplittingthem&quot;&gt;The videos, their length, and splitting them&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course consists of 20 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE18841CABEA24090&quot;&gt;video files&lt;/a&gt; and they are all uploaded on
Youtube already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one thing, though: while the lectures are naturally divided into
segments (the instructors took a break in after every 30 minutes or so worth
of lectures), the videos corresponding to each lecture have all the segments
concatenated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better watch them, accounting for the easier possibility to put a few of
the lectures in a mobile device or to avoid fast forwarding long videos from
my NAS when I am watching them on my TV (and some other factors), I decided
to sit down, take notes for each video of where the breaks where, and write
a simple Python script to help split the videos in segments, and, then,
reencode the segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided not to take the videos from Youtube to perform my splitting
activities, but, instead, to operate on one of the &quot;sources&quot; that the
authors once had in their homepage (videos encoded in DivX and audio in
MP3).  The videos are still available as a torrent file (with a magnet link
for the hash &lt;a href=&quot;magnet:?xt=urn:btih:650704e4439d7857a33fe4e32bcfdc2cb1db34db&quot;&gt;650704e4439d7857a33fe4e32bcfdc2cb1db34db&lt;/a&gt;), with some
very good souls still seeding it (I can seed it too, if desired).  Alas, I
have not found a source for the higher quality MPEG1 videos, but I think
that the videos are legible enough to avoid bothering with a larger
download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon found out that there are some beneficial side-effects of splitting
the videos, like not having to edit/equalize the entire audio of the videos
when only a segment was bad (which is understandable, as these lectures were
recorded almost 30 years ago and technology was not as advanced as things
are today).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, since I already have the split videos lying around here, I figured out
that, perhaps, other people may want to download them, as they may be more
convenient to watch (say, during commutes or whatever/whenever/wherever it
best suits them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, uploading all the videos is going to take a while and I would
only do it if people would really benefit from them.  If you think so, let
me know here (or if you know someone who would like the split version of the
videos, spread the word).&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;I was super sad to know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paco%20de%20Lucia&quot;&gt;Paco de Lucia&lt;/a&gt; passed a few days
ago. It was shocking to know that he was so young (only 66 year old, if I am
not mistaken).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To share some of his fine work with his frequent collaborators
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20McLaughlin&quot;&gt;John McLaughlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al%20Di%20Meola&quot;&gt;Al Di Meola&lt;/a&gt; to people that
may not otherwise know him or his work, I offered on a Facebook post to
upload a bootleg of a show of the Guitar Trio (John McLaughlin, Paco De
Lucia and Al Di Meola) with the entire performance (possibly out of order,
as that is a bootleg, after all) ripped from a broadcast to Dutch TV
station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This performance includes the exceptional Paco de Lucia prominently and the
show has many songs from the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday%20Night%20in%20San%20Francisco&quot;&gt;Friday Night in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;&quot;
record, including the magnificent (IMVHO)
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean%20Sundance&quot;&gt;Mediterranean Sundance&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The credits of the video are, of course, of the musicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only ripped, deinterlaced (remember, analog TV&amp;mdash;it was interlaced),
denoised, encoded, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/0tzfUYz2t5w&quot;&gt;uploaded the video to youtube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Seeing as recent versions of Xorg have made it into Debian&#39;s testing (which
I am using right now, instead of my usual sid installations), I decided to
see what they would bring me in terms of performance, since they have the
SNA acceleration implemented as well as the standard UXA acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I did not have any other tests to perform, but below are the results
on my wife&#39;s laptop (a Core i5 2410M), when running &lt;a href=&quot;http://packages.debian.org/gtkperf&quot;&gt;gtkperf&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;withuxa&quot;&gt;With UXA&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GtkPerf 0.40 - Starting testing: Mon Aug 12 20:33:20 2013

GtkEntry - time:  0.19
GtkComboBox - time:  5.36
GtkComboBoxEntry - time:  3.59
GtkSpinButton - time:  0.60
GtkProgressBar - time:  0.41
GtkToggleButton - time:  0.73
GtkCheckButton - time:  0.48
GtkRadioButton - time:  0.97
GtkTextView - Add text - time: 21.72
GtkTextView - Scroll - time:  2.29
GtkDrawingArea - Lines - time:  6.18
GtkDrawingArea - Circles - time:  6.74
GtkDrawingArea - Text - time:  4.32
GtkDrawingArea - Pixbufs - time:  0.67
 --- 
Total time: 54.25
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;withsna&quot;&gt;With SNA&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GtkPerf 0.40 - Starting testing: Mon Aug 12 20:36:58 2013

GtkEntry - time:  0.21
GtkComboBox - time:  4.86
GtkComboBoxEntry - time:  2.67
GtkSpinButton - time:  0.59
GtkProgressBar - time:  0.24
GtkToggleButton - time:  0.61
GtkCheckButton - time:  0.51
GtkRadioButton - time:  1.00
GtkTextView - Add text - time: 17.19
GtkTextView - Scroll - time:  1.84
GtkDrawingArea - Lines - time:  2.70
GtkDrawingArea - Circles - time:  2.65
GtkDrawingArea - Text - time:  1.72
GtkDrawingArea - Pixbufs - time:  0.11
 --- 
Total time: 36.91
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with SNA, the timing that I get are almost 2 times lower, which is
superb for a very simple &lt;code&gt;/etc/X11/xorg.conf&lt;/code&gt; config file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Section &quot;Device&quot;
        Identifier &quot;Intel Graphics&quot;
        Driver &quot;intel&quot;
        Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;sna&quot;
EndSection
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not noticed any change, but if drawing graphics faster means that I
get a bit more of battery life, then I will be super happy. I still have not
tested if this works on my notebook with a Core2Duo T7250. Crossing my
fingers so that it does.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s suppose that you went to a show of your favourite some time ago and
you were able to sneak in a camera (well, in those times, cell phones
weren&#39;t able to record much more than 176x144 pixels at 12fps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, then, you suddenly found that some people uploaded (short) fragments of
that very same show to youtube and, collecting those, you may be able to
create a &quot;multi-camera&quot; version of the video that you can record to keep of
your memorable concert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multi-camera, in the sense above, is not the same as
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Video#Chapters_and_angles&quot;&gt;multiple angles&lt;/a&gt; (like some DVDs), but something like a TV broadcast,
where the stage is filmed by cameras positioned at some places and the image
that is broadcast is switched from time to time according to that who is
singing, or playing etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Dear Lazyweb, do we happen to have any Free Software (preferably already
packaged in Debian) that is able to help with the task of &quot;aligning&quot; (in
time) videos from various (different) sources so as to produce one
multi-camera video?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would my options be? I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e7IPeuK1tQ&amp;amp;lc=Zwz7xq5ANT43j64jh8zLRYCMVRnJQgINcgSOhf-5Ozg&quot;&gt;asked this&lt;/a&gt; on youtube for a person that
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e7IPeuK1tQ&quot;&gt;did exactly what I want&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e7IPeuK1tQ&amp;amp;lc=Zwz7xq5ANT6jkGhCF9g1RzmZAsFIGmYzChDJwqwovNc&quot;&gt;their answer&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Vegas_Pro&quot;&gt;Sony Vegas&lt;/a&gt;,
which I fear that does not exactly would be allowed in Debian. &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any comments are welcome, thanks, and if I am successful, I will upload the
final video. &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;I just added some very, very preliminary support for web in &lt;code&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/code&gt; which &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes/2010/05/msg02694.html&quot;&gt;I uploaded&lt;/a&gt; to unstable some minutes ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, at least people will have some material (in, fact, a chance) to play with this format.  I implemented this because, so far, I was only hoping here that a player for this would emerge. I guess that Debian&#39;s ffmpeg/mplayer will take some time, but I was pleased to see that Sebastian Dröge to upload a version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes/2010/05/msg02596.html&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; that could use the new &lt;code&gt;libvpx&lt;/code&gt; codec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that, now, as a side effect of webm being widely available, more people become interested in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vorbis.com/&quot;&gt;Vorbis&lt;/a&gt;. More support (no, not &quot;alternative&quot;, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockbox.org/&quot;&gt;Rockbox&lt;/a&gt;, but straight from the manufacturers) for it in hardware devices will be sweet. Well, I can dream. &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:-)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it seems to be time to shape up that local build of mine of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.jp/aoyoume/aotuv/&quot;&gt;aotuv&lt;/a&gt; tuned version of Vorbis with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.jp/aoyoume/&quot;&gt;Aoyumi&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s patches for libvorbis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exciting times in the multimedia world.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Being the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free%20Software&quot;&gt;Free Software&lt;/a&gt; advocate that I am, I want to use as
much Free Software as I can (and spread the world).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: no, I don&#39;t like to call what I use
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%20Source&quot;&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.  I prefer the things the RMS way and if you
don&#39;t like the fact that I like his way, I&#39;m afraid that you may miss some
of the things that I have here, even if you don&#39;t necessarily agree with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I would like to use, see etc., the material that is available
on the Internet, that people has put available for others to see. In
particular, many Universities around the world are making the shift of being
only in the classroom to being present in their students&#39; lifes all the
time. This is accomplished by putting their educational material available
on-line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade or two ago, this was usually accomplished by publishing the
so-called &quot;lecture notes&quot; on the website of the course and maintaining
mailing-lists with the currently enrolled students. The lecture notes were
usually taken using the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe&quot;&gt;Scribe&lt;/a&gt; method&quot;, where, for each
class, one student is responsible of taking notes of the material, writing
it in a &quot;finished&quot; form and distributing it back for all the other
students. This was made in a round-robin fashion, as a means to spread the
responsibilities among the students taking the course. Also, the most common
tool used to edit the material, especially in Mathematically-oriented
courses, was to typeset everything in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX&quot;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; (or even plain
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX&quot;&gt;TeX&lt;/a&gt;, in some cases).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lecturer frequently distributed a template, which the students used and,
this way, all the notes written by the students had the same, uniform look
and style. The work was usually revised by the lecturer and, many times, it
resulted in a kind of a book, published in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device%5Findependent%5Ffile%5Fformat&quot;&gt;DVI&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript&quot;&gt;PostScript&lt;/a&gt; form (latter, it became common to use
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable%5Fdocument%5Fformat&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;, as it is a format more
popular).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, it is still quite frequent (and welcome!) to produce such lecture
notes. But, now, things have changed slightly. (I could discuss &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; things
have changed the way they have, but it is beyond the scope of these short
notes here.) People have been recording lectures in audio and, after the
technology became more accessible, in video. Now, a new term is used for
distributing those contents: &lt;em&gt;podcasting&lt;/em&gt;. Essentially, a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/podcast&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; is a way of publishing, say, audio so that people can
subscribe to your &quot;podcast&quot; (sometimes also said to be a &quot;channel&quot;). It is
very much like a radio program, where people tune in to listen to a given
program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way most people use to distribute the &quot;episodes&quot; of such
programs/podcasts is actually a combination of technologies, but nothing
exactly new: the description of &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is available is given in a format
called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; (which is a specialization of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt;,
but this isn&#39;t important for our subject matter) and the content is usually
in form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3&quot;&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt; files (or some variation of that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, enough background. Now, there are on-line stores on the Internet that
make available podcasts. Those podcasts are usually free of charge for the
listener. Some of the most prominent stores nowadays are
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%5FInc%2E&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &quot;iTunes Store&quot; and Amazon&#39;s store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has created its &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iTunes%20Store&quot;&gt;iTunes Store&lt;/a&gt;&quot; to foster the use of its
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iTunes&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; program and to boost the sales of its
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iPod&quot;&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; digital players (and, also, to make some extra money).
But people in the education field have seen that using a podcast would be a
good way of sharing knowledge and Apple wouldn&#39;t loose this market: they
invented the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes%5FStore%23iTunes%5FU&quot;&gt;iTunes U&lt;/a&gt;, which is
a way for Universities around the world to publish their content on &quot;iTunes
Store&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several big Universities have been putting their content on Apple&#39;s
iTunes-U. And, to see the directory of podcasts on iTunes-U, you have (in
theory) to use Apple&#39;s proprietary program iTunes, only available for
proprietary platforms: for Microsoft&#39;s Windows and for Apple&#39;s own
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac%20OS%20X&quot;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;. No Free Software alternative is officially
supported, despite the fact that the blurb on the Universities pages say
that only the access to the content has to be via iTunes and that the
content can be used with any MP3 player or with programs other than
iTunes. Yes, this means that the content is playable under
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and Linux plays a big role in higher education
environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, isn&#39;t there a way to access the blogs avoiding the use of proprietary
software? What about people that only want to use Free Software solutions
or, not even a matter of desiring to use Free Software, having only access
to Free Software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there is. Apple has changed the way that people use to get the
contents from its iTunes store during time, but, now, it seems to be quite
easy to grab it under a 100% Free environment. I have used this recipe for
two Universities only so far, but it has worked perfectly well. The
Universities in question are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT&quot;&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford%20University&quot;&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s say that you come across a link with the format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;itms://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/mit.edu.1330383747.01330383754.1330693646
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a link is &lt;em&gt;usually not&lt;/em&gt; recognized by browsers without the help of
extra software. In platforms where iTunes is available, the browser sends it
to iTunes and iTunes takes the duty of connecting to the &quot;iTunes Music
Store&quot; (that&#39;s where the &quot;itms&quot; thing at the beginning of the URL comes
from, by the way). Pay close attention to the part
&lt;code&gt;mit.edu.1330383747.01330383754.1330693646&lt;/code&gt;. That is the important part of
the URL here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is quite easy to convert the link above to something that can be
grabbed with a usual browser or, say, a program like wget or curl. Just
write the link as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/DownloadTracksFile/mit.edu.1330383747.01330383754.1330693646.mp4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The part up to and including &lt;code&gt;DownloadTracksFile/&lt;/code&gt; is constant. Only the
part after it is changed and taken from the original link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another way of rewriting the link. Its format is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/FeedEnclosure/mit.edu.1330383747.01330383754.1330693646/enclosure.mp4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the middle part of this URL is the actual part that we alluded
to. The rest is simply a constant thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this way, we can get the contents of podcasts with Free Software in an
automated way. That is, until Apple changes its scheme of doing things. But,
by that time, we will already have the things we want and newer solutions
can be devised soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&#39;s fire those wget&#39;s and start to study things (or prozilla&#39;s,
aria2c&#39;s etc, for some speed boost).&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;In the past few days, I did quite a good amount of things. One of
the things that took most of my mind was to convert some videos in
a proper format for the iPod. At first, I thought that the format
of the videos would have to have an H.264 encoded video with
resolution 320x240 (without using cabac, which increases the
compression factor of the video) and audio in the AAC format with
bitrates up to 160kbps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, using Apple&#39;s Quicktime Pro 7, I exported a video from the
Dutch band called After Forever, which had the resolution bigger
than 320x240. This made me revisit Apple&#39;s site where the
specifications of videos meant to be played on iPods. It seems
that, now, with the latest firmware update, the iPod that I have
can play H.264 videos encoded with resolutions up to 640x480 (the
standard VGA resolution). Also, the bitrate doesn&#39;t need to be
restricted to 768kbps: some of the videos produced by Quicktime
(and which the iPods can play) have bitrates of up to 1500kbps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that I can now encode some of my videos that are in the
nasty WMV format to formats that can be supported in a decent
manner by Free Software system. I have, for instance, the
BBC-produced DVD called &quot;The Codebreakers&quot;, whose audio is in pure
DVD LPCM format (that is, uncompressed) and the space that it takes
on my hard disk is considerable (approx. 1GB).&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Today was a very unusual day: it was quite active and I didn&#39;t have
a day like today for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had slept quite late, since I was waiting for
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s Quicktime 7 Pro for Windows (on my
girlfriend&#39;s computer) to finish the conversion of a video from one
of Cynic&#39;s show from their reunion. It was a show that was webcast
by the Norwegian company nhk.no (if I&#39;m not mistaken) and the show
is superb (it was from 2007 and they even played a, then,
unreleased song called &quot;Evolutionary Sleeper&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing of it all is that even though we where using a
x86-based machine (actually, a Duron 1.3GHz on a board with a SiS
730 chipset), which supported even SSE, things were quite slow. In
fact, the show took 1 day and some hours to be completely
&quot;exported&quot; in the iPod format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that was noteworthy was that my GF had some CDs that
she had burned and that contained some audio files from a course
that she took some time ago. Since those classes are quite
important and they interest me, I would like to listen to them. The
&quot;problem&quot; is that they are in IMA ADPCM format which most car
players don&#39;t play. The solution, in this case, will be to use lame
with libsndfile1 as input and convert the files to the MP3 format,
so that I can neatly tag the files and listen to them on my (and
her) car player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is only the beginning of the story, since two of her CDs
were not readable on my iBook G3, dammit. I, then, took the time to
download dvdisaster on her Windows computer (first, the stable
version; then, the more feature-full development version) and I
left the CDs being read. Unfortunately, it seems that even
dvdisaster is having a hard time reading many sectors of the CD-RWs
(and, yes, I did wash the discs with abundant water and used a very
soft towel to get them dry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, another thing that I&#39;ve learned was that uTorrent is very
featureful. Apparently, much more featureful than Transmission. I&#39;d
say that its features are on par with Azureus (even though I have
not used Azureus for a loooong time, as it is Java-based and my
machines don&#39;t have enough horsepower for programs that are not
natively compiled).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the torrent to grab Ubuntu&#39;s jaunty alpha 3, so that I can
experiment with things to come (and the new notification system
that Mark has proposed. I actually liked it very much, but I am
eager to see it working). The only catch is that my GF&#39;s connection
is only 150kbps and things are &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; slow here, but I&#39;m getting
the image anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I woke up, I went to the proctologist. After that, I went to
see a friend of mine from the high-school days, that is now a
neuro-cirugeon, I had lost contact with him, but I sincerely hope
to get back in touch frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I went with my GF to the bank where she has her account to
see if he had some residual money from a nation-wide program called
FGTS. She did have, but some documents were missing. The worker
that received us told her that she could mail some of the missing
documentation via e-mail and we scanned the necessary
documentation, but the mails bounced. Bummer. At least, the trip to
the bank wasn&#39;t completely useless, since I saw that I have some
money on this FGTS thing and it was a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latter, I went to the local theater and saw that professors are
able to have a 50% discount on the entrance to see the movies,
given that we prove that we are actually active. This is a very
nice thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also saw the price of a new, Classic 120GB iPod. It wasn&#39;t
available on the store that I went to, but other store of the same
name has some units. I guess that I should see one. I was only
surprised to see that the 160GB model doesn&#39;t seem to be sold
anymore. Any reason for that? That left me puzzled, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the electronics store, I also saw a netbook from HP that was
sweet. Soooo small, so cute. I guess that I need one. It has a very
small form factor and it features a 1.2GHz VIA C7M processor. The
only things that made the red alert lights blink for me were the
Broadcom network interfaces: both wired and wireless, and Broadcom
is know to not be exactly that helpful with the Free Software
Movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I went to get a haircut and my girlfriend told me that
it was good. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latter, before going to her place, we went to my home just for a
little while so that I could see how the torrents for MIT&#39;s &quot;The
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Program&quot; MPEG1 videos were
going. Not good at all. Everything is stalled. I guess that I will
need to use this uTorrent thing (at least, experiment with it) so
that I can see if the downloads are slightly better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did something unusual: scanned a 3x4 (centimeters, of
course!) photo of mine (which is needed here in Brazil for quite a
lot of documents) and collated it in 3 rows, in a way that I will
have 9 pics. I will print two of them (and have 18 pictures) for
R$0.69 each, which is not a bad deal. My girlfriend liked the idea
and I will do the same thing for her, since she will need many
photos for her id&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we got the vacuum cleaner to clean up her place (mostly
the TV room) and I cleaned her fan (which was quite dusty).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, the day will be quite full and I will have a lot of
things to do in this endless saga. I hope to write more about this
hectic (but pleasant) week.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Today, most of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnome.org/&quot;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt; 2.12 has entered
testing, which is good. Also
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openoffice.org/&quot;&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt; 2.0.1 also entered.
Let&#39;s see if it plays some presentations that I have here that were
&lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt; when played with OO.o 2.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugh! Paying through the roof for the mistakes made the other day.
An arm and a leg. &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/sad.png&quot; alt=&quot;:-(&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hooray! Finally the Nightwish torrent from their 2003-06-20 show is
complete. It was a digital broadcast show and the quality is
amazing. I only had this one on a DivX file, but now that I have
the real thing, I will burn this one. The only &quot;problem&quot; is that it
only uses half of a DVD. Is there any way of putting another show
in a DVD, without having to author it and destroy its current
structure? That would definitely be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
