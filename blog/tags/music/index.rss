	<description>&lt;p&gt;I was super sad to know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paco%20de%20Lucia&quot;&gt;Paco de Lucia&lt;/a&gt; passed a few days
ago. It was shocking to know that he was so young (only 66 year old, if I am
not mistaken).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To share some of his fine work with his frequent collaborators
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20McLaughlin&quot;&gt;John McLaughlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al%20Di%20Meola&quot;&gt;Al Di Meola&lt;/a&gt; to people that
may not otherwise know him or his work, I offered on a Facebook post to
upload a bootleg of a show of the Guitar Trio (John McLaughlin, Paco De
Lucia and Al Di Meola) with the entire performance (possibly out of order,
as that is a bootleg, after all) ripped from a broadcast to Dutch TV
station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This performance includes the exceptional Paco de Lucia prominently and the
show has many songs from the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday%20Night%20in%20San%20Francisco&quot;&gt;Friday Night in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;&quot;
record, including the magnificent (IMVHO)
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean%20Sundance&quot;&gt;Mediterranean Sundance&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The credits of the video are, of course, of the musicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only ripped, deinterlaced (remember, analog TV&amp;mdash;it was interlaced),
denoised, encoded, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/0tzfUYz2t5w&quot;&gt;uploaded the video to youtube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This post is just a bunch of random notes, but I think that things are going
well, this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;btrfs&quot;&gt;Btrfs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just started playing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/btrfs&quot;&gt;btrfs&lt;/a&gt; after converting a 2TB disk
with about 1.3TB of data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ext4&quot;&gt;ext4&lt;/a&gt; to btrfs.  This particular
filesystem contains my backup data and I hope that btrfs is able to live up
to high standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will probably write a detailed review with my impressions, but suffice to
say that it is working fine and I hope that I will be happy for a long time
to come. My other filesystems, for the moment, will be ext4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;courseradownloader&quot;&gt;Coursera Downloader&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jplehmann&quot;&gt;John Lehmann&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s generosity, now &lt;code&gt;coursera-dl&lt;/code&gt; has a new home:
a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coursera-dl&quot;&gt;github organization&lt;/a&gt; of its own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;youtube-dl&quot;&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/1612&quot;&gt;Some people may have noticed, others may not&lt;/a&gt;, but when downloading
videos from Youtube, they apparently are getting more aggressive with the
use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic%20Adaptive%20Streaming%20over%20HTTP&quot;&gt;Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP&lt;/a&gt; (also called
DASH) and, as a result, some (perhaps going to be all in the near future?)
of the videos may not be available in the resolution/formats that you used
to like (like me, with format number 35).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, one thing that is interesting with youtube videos provided via
DASH is that they are available in different streams: one for the video and
another for the audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean in practical terms for users of youtube-dl?  Well, if
you wanted to download videos in resolutions like the 480p (format 35) that
I mentioned, then you will probably have to change your way of doing things,
until a more automated solution is in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will have to download both the audio and the video and, then, &quot;combine&quot;
them (that is, multiplex them) to create one &quot;normal&quot; video file with both
the audio and the video. I usually do this via:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
ffmpeg -i audio.m4a -i video.mp4 -vcodec copy -acodec copy combined.mp4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer having a Matroska container instead of an mp4 container
(which, BTW, results in &lt;em&gt;smaller&lt;/em&gt; muxing overhead), then you can use the
command line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
mkvmerge -o combined.mkv audio.m4a video.mp4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, those &lt;code&gt;m4a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mp4&lt;/code&gt; extensions are a new addition that
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/pull/1622&quot;&gt;I just sent upstream&lt;/a&gt; (in the past, both would have been named with an
extension of &lt;code&gt;mp4&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As, an aside, I like formats &lt;code&gt;135&lt;/code&gt; for video and &lt;code&gt;140&lt;/code&gt; for audio, for the
reasons that I mentioned in a comments to issue 1612:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, to download 480p videos (which I do for lectures and so on with
  other projects of mine, like edx-dl) I have to call youtube-dl twice: once
  for format 135 and another for format 140, since the old &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/question.png&quot; alt=&quot;(?)&quot; /&gt; format 35
  files are much smaller than the lower resolution 360p files (due to the
  former being encoded in High profile vs. the latter being encoded in
  Constrained Baseline profile).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is unfortunate for some, this is a good thing for others: I once
had a blind user of &lt;code&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/code&gt; asking me if he could avoid downloading the
whole video just to extract the audio, so that he save on bandwidth. Well,
now this is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect a new version of &lt;code&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/code&gt; to be uploaded soon to Debian unstable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;music&quot;&gt;Music&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is so nice to see the music that I like getting better. It was
particularly pleasant to &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/hAnVFJFmFx8&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarja%20Turunen&quot;&gt;Tarja Turunen&lt;/a&gt; being joined
on stage by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor%20Jansen&quot;&gt;Floor Jansen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is my impression that the once female-fronted bands are getting
more and more into collaborations and side-projects and they are, in many
ways, getting more refined. Examples of this includes Floor, Tarja,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anneke%20van%20Giersbergen&quot;&gt;Anneke van Giersbergen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon%20den%20Adel&quot;&gt;Sharon den Adel&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari%20Ruesl%C3%A5tten&quot;&gt;Kari Rueslåtten&lt;/a&gt; and many others that I can&#39;t remember right
now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, some thanks to people that take the time to film, and
upload/share the videos so that other people not at these events can watch
them is highly appreciated and they usually are treated as anonymous, but,
of course, this should be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>A Wish: The Ability of Playing MP3 CDs/DVDs created by iTunes with Free Software</title>

	<dcterms:modified>2012-09-07T06:54:06Z</dcterms:modified>


	<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple&#39;s iTunes has a very cool feature that I would like to have and that I
still have not yet noticed in any of the Linux music players (be them
rhythmbox, amarok, quodlibet, audacious etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feature is the following: Apple&#39;s iTunes player has the possibility of
playing CD-DA, with the information about the tracks (in computer jargon,
metadata) taken from on-line databases like Gracenote&#39;s CDDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Free Software that I use doesn&#39;t have problems with this, at least
regarding audio CDs. They check some free on-line databases (like gnudb.org
or freedb.org, which, by the way, have CDs in their catalog that aren&#39;t
available in the commercial CDDB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the nicest feature that iTunes has is the ability to burn MP3/AAC CDs
taken from playlists composed by the user, neatly organized in a filesystem
structure of the format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;artist&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;album&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;song&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also generates an XML file with the contents of the MP3 CD in a way that
makes it playable just like a CD-DA, but with remarkable characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it doesn&#39;t need a connection to the Internet to grab metadata (which is,
of course, stored both in the XML file and in some file&#39;s metadata). This
means that no network connection is necessary to have information about
songs and the XML file acts like a cache to avoid the program reading the
whole CD to show the information in a user-friendly fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the MP3 CD is treated like a CD-DA, but with a much longer capacity (say,
12 hours, depending on the bitrate of the songs and their lengths).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the songs don&#39;t have to be imported into playlists and not even queued for
playing. Just selecting the first song to be played is enough for it to
start plaing things (and, of course, it is not always that we want to
import songs to our library).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I think that this would be a great thing for the GNOME
Desktop (and for others too), since it would increase the interoperability
with other Operating Systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only iTunes can create such CDs, but it can also create DVDs containing
MP3/AAC files, which, of course, means that the capacity of such &quot;CDs&quot; is
huge compared to that of usual audio CDs and it is also a convenient way to
carry the discs around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience and workflow, it would be really nice to be able to play
such CDs/DVDs with rhythmbox/amarok/quodlibet, as it would represent both a
handy feature and a nice interoperability factor (and convenience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Free Software players, more formats could be considered, of
course, than just MP3 and Low Complexity AAC. Vorbis, Speex, MP2, AC-3 and
other less-known formats would be possible (well, even Window&#39;s WMA files,
as they are playable by a lot of set-top boxes and car players).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, in addition to playing such CDs/DVDs, those programs could also create
such CDs (say, by passing the responsibility to another program), then
everything would be a dream come true and many other friends of mine would
be one step further from being tied to Mac OS X or Windows and closer to
Free Software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that this shows to be an improvement for the Free Software Desktop
environments like GNOME and KDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.: The same thing applies to Photo CDs created by iPhoto. It would be
really exciting to have them be recognized by F-Spot or other similar Photo
organizers.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Getting things from the iTunes Music Store without iTunes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Being the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free%20Software&quot;&gt;Free Software&lt;/a&gt; advocate that I am, I want to use as
much Free Software as I can (and spread the world).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: no, I don&#39;t like to call what I use
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%20Source&quot;&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.  I prefer the things the RMS way and if you
don&#39;t like the fact that I like his way, I&#39;m afraid that you may miss some
of the things that I have here, even if you don&#39;t necessarily agree with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I would like to use, see etc., the material that is available
on the Internet, that people has put available for others to see. In
particular, many Universities around the world are making the shift of being
only in the classroom to being present in their students&#39; lifes all the
time. This is accomplished by putting their educational material available
on-line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade or two ago, this was usually accomplished by publishing the
so-called &quot;lecture notes&quot; on the website of the course and maintaining
mailing-lists with the currently enrolled students. The lecture notes were
usually taken using the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe&quot;&gt;Scribe&lt;/a&gt; method&quot;, where, for each
class, one student is responsible of taking notes of the material, writing
it in a &quot;finished&quot; form and distributing it back for all the other
students. This was made in a round-robin fashion, as a means to spread the
responsibilities among the students taking the course. Also, the most common
tool used to edit the material, especially in Mathematically-oriented
courses, was to typeset everything in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX&quot;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; (or even plain
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX&quot;&gt;TeX&lt;/a&gt;, in some cases).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lecturer frequently distributed a template, which the students used and,
this way, all the notes written by the students had the same, uniform look
and style. The work was usually revised by the lecturer and, many times, it
resulted in a kind of a book, published in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device%5Findependent%5Ffile%5Fformat&quot;&gt;DVI&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript&quot;&gt;PostScript&lt;/a&gt; form (latter, it became common to use
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable%5Fdocument%5Fformat&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;, as it is a format more
popular).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, it is still quite frequent (and welcome!) to produce such lecture
notes. But, now, things have changed slightly. (I could discuss &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; things
have changed the way they have, but it is beyond the scope of these short
notes here.) People have been recording lectures in audio and, after the
technology became more accessible, in video. Now, a new term is used for
distributing those contents: &lt;em&gt;podcasting&lt;/em&gt;. Essentially, a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/podcast&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; is a way of publishing, say, audio so that people can
subscribe to your &quot;podcast&quot; (sometimes also said to be a &quot;channel&quot;). It is
very much like a radio program, where people tune in to listen to a given
program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way most people use to distribute the &quot;episodes&quot; of such
programs/podcasts is actually a combination of technologies, but nothing
exactly new: the description of &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is available is given in a format
called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; (which is a specialization of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt;,
but this isn&#39;t important for our subject matter) and the content is usually
in form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3&quot;&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt; files (or some variation of that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, enough background. Now, there are on-line stores on the Internet that
make available podcasts. Those podcasts are usually free of charge for the
listener. Some of the most prominent stores nowadays are
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%5FInc%2E&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &quot;iTunes Store&quot; and Amazon&#39;s store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has created its &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iTunes%20Store&quot;&gt;iTunes Store&lt;/a&gt;&quot; to foster the use of its
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iTunes&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; program and to boost the sales of its
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iPod&quot;&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; digital players (and, also, to make some extra money).
But people in the education field have seen that using a podcast would be a
good way of sharing knowledge and Apple wouldn&#39;t loose this market: they
invented the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes%5FStore%23iTunes%5FU&quot;&gt;iTunes U&lt;/a&gt;, which is
a way for Universities around the world to publish their content on &quot;iTunes
Store&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several big Universities have been putting their content on Apple&#39;s
iTunes-U. And, to see the directory of podcasts on iTunes-U, you have (in
theory) to use Apple&#39;s proprietary program iTunes, only available for
proprietary platforms: for Microsoft&#39;s Windows and for Apple&#39;s own
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac%20OS%20X&quot;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;. No Free Software alternative is officially
supported, despite the fact that the blurb on the Universities pages say
that only the access to the content has to be via iTunes and that the
content can be used with any MP3 player or with programs other than
iTunes. Yes, this means that the content is playable under
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and Linux plays a big role in higher education
environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, isn&#39;t there a way to access the blogs avoiding the use of proprietary
software? What about people that only want to use Free Software solutions
or, not even a matter of desiring to use Free Software, having only access
to Free Software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there is. Apple has changed the way that people use to get the
contents from its iTunes store during time, but, now, it seems to be quite
easy to grab it under a 100% Free environment. I have used this recipe for
two Universities only so far, but it has worked perfectly well. The
Universities in question are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT&quot;&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford%20University&quot;&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s say that you come across a link with the format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;itms://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/mit.edu.1330383747.01330383754.1330693646
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a link is &lt;em&gt;usually not&lt;/em&gt; recognized by browsers without the help of
extra software. In platforms where iTunes is available, the browser sends it
to iTunes and iTunes takes the duty of connecting to the &quot;iTunes Music
Store&quot; (that&#39;s where the &quot;itms&quot; thing at the beginning of the URL comes
from, by the way). Pay close attention to the part
&lt;code&gt;mit.edu.1330383747.01330383754.1330693646&lt;/code&gt;. That is the important part of
the URL here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is quite easy to convert the link above to something that can be
grabbed with a usual browser or, say, a program like wget or curl. Just
write the link as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/DownloadTracksFile/mit.edu.1330383747.01330383754.1330693646.mp4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The part up to and including &lt;code&gt;DownloadTracksFile/&lt;/code&gt; is constant. Only the
part after it is changed and taken from the original link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another way of rewriting the link. Its format is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/FeedEnclosure/mit.edu.1330383747.01330383754.1330693646/enclosure.mp4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the middle part of this URL is the actual part that we alluded
to. The rest is simply a constant thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this way, we can get the contents of podcasts with Free Software in an
automated way. That is, until Apple changes its scheme of doing things. But,
by that time, we will already have the things we want and newer solutions
can be devised soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&#39;s fire those wget&#39;s and start to study things (or prozilla&#39;s,
aria2c&#39;s etc, for some speed boost).&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Didn&#39;t sleep too much today (actually I spent the whole night awake
trying to understand the simple program presented on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; for the generation of the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_series&quot;&gt;Farey Series&lt;/a&gt; (as Hardy
&amp;amp; Wright call them). Finally, looking at my copy of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics&quot;&gt;&quot;Concrete Mathematics&quot;&lt;/a&gt;,
I discovered a &quot;bonus problem&quot; (read: a very hard problem) that has
a deceivingly simple solution that I was looking for the past few
days to justify the program correctness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latter, I went with my dad to &quot;Galeria do Rock&quot; to grab myself a
copy of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_of_Salvation&quot;&gt;Pain of Salvation&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
&quot;Be&quot; (DVD+CD),
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristania_(band)&quot;&gt;Tristania&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
&quot;Widow&#39;s Weeds&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opeth&quot;&gt;Opeth&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverance_(Opeth_album)&quot;&gt;&quot;Deliverance&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m actually excited to see Dream Theater&#39;s releases &quot;Live in
Tokyo&quot; and &quot;5 Years in a Livetime&quot; on DVD. I guess that my
collection of their DVDs is now almost complete. So excited to see
&quot;5 Years in a Livetime&quot; that I had actually a personal problem here
at home.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Had the pleasant company of a friend when going to the theater so
that we could watch
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/&quot;&gt;&quot;The Bucket List&quot;&lt;/a&gt; (&quot;Antes
de Partir&quot;), with Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. While waiting
for the flick session to start, we went to Saraiva Megastore, and
browsing through their DVD shows, I found
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dreamtheater.net/&quot;&gt;Dream Theater&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dreamtheater.net/disco_videography.php?s=budokan2dvd&quot;&gt;&quot;Live at Budokan&quot;&lt;/a&gt;
for a feasible price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very pleasant evening and the company was especially
good.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The acoustic show of Pain of Salvation is really nice. I didn&#39;t have enough
time to watch it yet, but it is an amazing thing that should be kept, as the
performance is superb (I did look quickly at some points of it and, of
course, the expectations have been met---we are, after all, talking about a
band that has a unique touch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, speaking about unique bands, I will be seeing Opeth playing live here in
Brazil. Yes. This day has arrived. I will see my favourite band playing
here. I guess that I have to get in touch with Mikael and see if I can sneak
in a camera, so that I can shot and film the show.  This will be amazing, to
say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Found out about &quot;The Right Way (TM)&quot; to hash an existing SSH&#39;s &lt;code&gt;known_hosts&lt;/code&gt;
file (&lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen -H&lt;/code&gt;) and how to remove a hashed host entry from your
&lt;code&gt;known_hosts&lt;/code&gt; file: &lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen -H -R host.name&lt;/code&gt;.  I needed this for newer
checkouts of LAME&#39;s CVS repository at &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf.net/&quot;&gt;Sourceforge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, BTW, just to save myself the trouble of looking it up again, here is the
link to the place where sourceforge keeps their &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/sitedocs/wiki/SSH%20key%20fingerprints&quot;&gt;SSH key fingerprints&lt;/a&gt;.
I&#39;m always lost trying to find it, so I thought that it would be best to
record it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also discovered a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; amazing thing: a &lt;a href=&quot;http://librivox.org/&quot;&gt;free source of audiobooks&lt;/a&gt;
in podcast format, while I was looking for René Descartes&#39; &quot;The Method&quot;.
While surfing the net, I also found that there is this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dominiopublico.gov.br/pesquisa/DetalheObraForm.do?select_action=&amp;amp;co_obra=2274&quot;&gt;very same text&lt;/a&gt;
in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dominiopublico.gov.br/&quot;&gt;Brazilian site&lt;/a&gt; backed by the government that hosts works in the
public domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still downloading Pain of Salvation&#39;s Acoustic set. Now, I finally had some
time to watch the somewhat incomplete VOBs and it, indeed, has the show. And
it is an amazing piece of music. Recommended for all fans of good music.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I resurrected Loreena McKennitt&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mask_and_Mirror&quot;&gt;&quot;The Mask and Mirror&quot;&lt;/a&gt;
and it now plays without skipping in any place. It&#39;s so nice to
have it &quot;back&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m slowly progressing towards a better condition of my throat.
This is taking longer than what I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally took some time to go to the police station to register the
damage done to my car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I got some new toys to play with, including a brand new
Firewire enclosure, wireless stuff and some DVD-R&#39;s. Fun ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
