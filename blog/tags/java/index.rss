	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://junit.org/junit5/&quot;&gt;JUnit 5&lt;/a&gt;, the latest release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://junit.org/&quot;&gt;JUnit&lt;/a&gt;, from
Eclipse, then you have to change your import from &lt;code&gt;import org.junit.Test;&lt;/code&gt;
to &lt;code&gt;import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;&lt;/code&gt;. Notice the &lt;code&gt;jupiter.api&lt;/code&gt; there in
the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the test runner will complain and tell you that you don&#39;t have
tests in your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The not-so-minimal test that I created was the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;package test;

import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.*;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class FirstTest {
    @Test
    void test() {
        assertThat(1+1, is(equalTo(2)));
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I printed the first draft of the first chapter when my little boy
was here and he was impressed with this strange object called a &quot;printer&quot;.
Before I printed what I needed, I fired up LibreOffice and chose the biggest
font size that was available and let him type his first name by himself.
He was quicker than I thought with a keyboard. After seeing me print his
first name, he was jumping up and down with joy of having created something
and even showed grandma and grandpa what he had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He, then, wanted more and I taught him how to use that backspace key, what
it meant and he wanted to type his full name. I let him and taught him that
there is a key called space that he should type every time he wants to start
a new word and, in the end, he typed his first two names. To my surprise, he
memorized the icon with the printer (which I must say that I have to hunt
every time, since it seems so similar to the adjacent ones!) and pressed
this new key called &quot;Enter&quot;. When he pressed, he wasn&#39;t expecting the
printer on his right to start making noises and printing his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was so excited and it was so nice to see his reaction full of joy to get
a job done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of getting a spare computer, building it with him and for him,
so that he can call it his computer every time he comes to see daddy. As a
serendipitous situation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packtpub.com/&quot;&gt;Packt Publishing&lt;/a&gt; offered yesterday their
title &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/python-projects-kids&quot;&gt;&quot;Python Projects for Kids&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, he does
not yet know how to read, but I guess that the right age is coming soon,
which is a good thing to make him be educated &quot;the right way&quot; (that is, with
the best support, teaching and patience that I can give him).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I printed the first draft of the first chapter and today I have to
turn it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, I am &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/&quot;&gt;downloading a virtual machine from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; to
try to install Java on it. Let me see if it works. I have none of the
virtualization options used, tough the closest seems to be virtualbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me cross my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I updated some of the tags of very old posts of this blog,
and I am seriously thinking about switching from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ikiwiki.info/&quot;&gt;ikiwiki&lt;/a&gt; to another
blog platform. It is &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;very slow&lt;/em&gt; on my system with the repositories
that I have, especially on my armel system. Some non-interpreted system
would be best, but I don&#39;t know if such a thing even exists. But the killer
problem is that it doesn&#39;t support easily the typing of Mathematics (even
though a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bk/ikiwiki-plugin-mathjax&quot;&gt;3rd party plugin&lt;/a&gt; for MathJax exists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I just received &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/telegram/status/927470283094499329&quot;&gt;an answer on twitter&lt;/a&gt; from @telegram and
it was nice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello, Telegram supports bold and italic. You can type &lt;code&gt;**bold**&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__italic__&lt;/code&gt;. On mobile, you can also highlight text for this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is nice that this works with &lt;a href=&quot;https://packages.debian.org/sid/telegram-desktop&quot;&gt;telegram-desktop&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that, I filed some bugs on Debian&#39;s BTS, responded to some issues on
my projects on GitHub (I&#39;m slowly getting back on maintaining things) and
file &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bk/ikiwiki-plugin-mathjax/issues/3&quot;&gt;wishlist bugs on some other projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I grabbed a copy of &quot;Wonder woman&quot; (&quot;Mulher Maravilha&quot;) and
&quot;Despicable Me 3&quot; (&quot;Meu Malvado Favorito 3&quot;) dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese
for my son. I have to convert the audio from AAC-LC in 6 channels to AC3 or
to stereo. Otherwise, my TVs have problem with the videos (one refuses to
play the entire file and another plays the audio with sounds of hiccups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; After converting the VirtualBox image taken from Microsoft, I
could easily use &lt;code&gt;qemu&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;kvm&lt;/code&gt; to create screenshots of the installation of
Java.  The command that I used (for future reference) is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -smp 2 -net nic,model=e1000 -net user -soundhw ac97 -drive index=0,media=disk,cache=unsafe,file=win7.qcow2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Fixed some typos.&lt;/p&gt;

	<dcterms:modified>2017-11-03T01:02:44Z</dcterms:modified>


	<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I spent some time in the morning seeing how one would install the JDK
on Linux distributions. This is to create a little comparative tutorial to
teach introductory Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing the JDK is, thanks to the OpenJDK developers in Debian and Ubuntu
(Matthias Klose and helpers), a very easy task. You simply type something
like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since for a student it is better to have everything for experiments, I
install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://packages.debian.org/sid/openjdk-8-jdk&quot;&gt;full version&lt;/a&gt;, not only the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://packages.debian.org/sid/openjdk-8-jdk-headless&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;-headless&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; version. Given my familiarity with
Debian/Ubuntu, I didn&#39;t have to think about the way of installing it, of
course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as this is a tutorial meant to be as general as I can, I tried also to
include instructions on how to install Java on other distributions. The
first two that came to my mind were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensuse.org/&quot;&gt;openSUSE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://getfedora.org/&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both use the RPM package format for their &quot;native&quot; packages (in the same
sense that Debian uses DEB packages for &quot;native&quot; packages). But they use
different higher-level tools to install such packages: Fedora uses a tool
called &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DNF&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dnf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while openSUSE uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Zypper_usage&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;zypper&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try these distributions, I got their netinstall ISOs and used
&lt;code&gt;qemu&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;kvm&lt;/code&gt; to install on a virtual machine. I used the following to
install/run the virtual machines (the example below, is, of course, for openSUSE):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -smp 2 -net nic,model=e1000 -net user -drive index=0,media=disk,cache=unsafe,file=suse.qcow2 -cdrom openSUSE-Leap-42.3-NET-x86_64.iso
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The names of the packages also change from one distribution to another. On
Fedora, I had to use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On openSUSE, I had to use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;zypper install java-1_8_0-openjdk-devel
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that one distribution uses dots in the names of the packages while the
other uses underscores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing that I noticed with &lt;code&gt;dnf&lt;/code&gt; was that, when I used it, it
automatically refreshed the package lists from the network, something which
I forgot, and it was a pleasant surprise. I don&#39;t know about &lt;code&gt;zypper&lt;/code&gt;, but I
guess that it probably had fresh indices when the installation finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both installations were effortless after I knew the names of the packages to
install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, BTW, in my 5 minute exploration with these distributions, I noticed that
if you don&#39;t want the JDK, but only the JRE, then you omit the &lt;code&gt;-devel&lt;/code&gt;
suffix.  It makes sense when you think about it, for consistency with other
packages, but Debian&#39;s conventions also make sense (JRE with &lt;code&gt;-jre&lt;/code&gt; suffix,
JDK with &lt;code&gt;-jdk&lt;/code&gt; suffix).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I failed miserably to use Fedora&#39;s prebaked, vanilla
&lt;a href=&quot;https://alt.fedoraproject.org/cloud/&quot;&gt;cloud image&lt;/a&gt;, as I couldn&#39;t login on this image and I decided
to just install the whole OS on a fresh virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t have instructions on how to install on &lt;a href=&quot;https://getfedora.org/&quot;&gt;Gentoo&lt;/a&gt; nor on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archlinux.org/&quot;&gt;Arch&lt;/a&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now see how hard it is to cover instructions/provide software for as many
distributions as you wish, given the multitude of package managers,
conventions etc.&lt;/p&gt;

	<dcterms:modified>2014-03-03T05:38:09Z</dcterms:modified>


	<description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend I received my 17th certification (or Statement of
Accomplishment) for MOOCs. In particular, this last MOOC that I took was
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/course/androidapps101&quot;&gt;Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps&lt;/a&gt;, offered by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/instructor/lawrenceangrave&quot;&gt;Lawrence Angrave&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/illinois&quot;&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I certainly knew that the course was an Introduction to Programming,
the reasons I took it were twofold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &quot;novelty&quot; (for me, at least) of writing some Android Apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reacquaint myself with Java, which I have not touched since 1999, when
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbrito/old-projects&quot;&gt;I wrote a compiler&lt;/a&gt;, in the ages of JDK 1.0 being transitioned to
JDK 1.1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the time the course took (and which I invested in) was really
well spent. In fact, I learned some nice things which I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have
touched otherwise. For instance, I made the conscious effort to use an IDE
(Eclipse), despite being a person that would do most of the things inside
Emacs and compile the programs with command-line tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being huge, Eclipse has some really nice features and the
auto-completion is amazing. Since Java is so strongly typed and Eclipse
knows Java pretty well, it almost completely writes your programs for you.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, my interest also made me want to streamline the build process and
use the command line tools (with ant, another tool that was &quot;alien&quot; to me,
having used makefiles for everything that I needed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Eclipse (and the Android development environment in general) in
my Debian unstable computers
&lt;a href=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//posts/2014-01-17-developing_for_android_with_debian/&quot;&gt;was not&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.debian.org/734674&quot;&gt;without problems&lt;/a&gt;, but after spending more time trying to fix Eclipse
than really doing the homework (and pulling the little hair that I still
have left), one really helpful post &lt;a href=&quot;http://aleksz-programming.blogspot.com/2013/03/eclipse-and-webkit-on-ubuntu-64.html&quot;&gt;nailed it&lt;/a&gt;. (Yes, I had to remove
other packages like gimp, but such is life).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While playing with the Android side of things, I put one badly written (and
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; really &quot;android-ish&quot;) app in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbrito/toy-android-apps&quot;&gt;a github repository&lt;/a&gt; (which I think
is aptly named &quot;Toy Android Apps&quot;), which served me the purpose of learning
some Android-specific concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the course was helpful not only to get in touch with the tools (Eclipse,
ant, running Android virtual machines with the help of kvm), but also on the
Java side. I lost a bit of the prejudice against it (even though I still
think it is a verbose language, especially when compared to, say Python),
and I, also intend to contribute to one apache project or another that have
low-hanging fruits.  Actually, I have signed their
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt&quot;&gt;Contributor License Agreement&lt;/a&gt; and I even had
&lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;amp;revision=1559792&quot;&gt;my first patch accepted&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside: Well, sadly SVN doesn&#39;t support different committer and author fields
like git does and it seems that doing many small commits may not be the
Apache way of doing things&amp;mdash;but the important part of all this is that
the code is there and there is so much more to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside #2: After a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time spent converting the repository to git
(which is, after all, what I use), I put &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbrito/commons-graph&quot;&gt;a mirror&lt;/a&gt; of Apache&#39;s the
commons graph project.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I have just enrolled in a MOOC to learn about programming with Android.
There are many tutorials and reports of people using Linux for the
development of the apps out there, but, unfortunately, many of them are
outdated or contain misleading information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will find bazillion instructions out there telling you to install
JDK6. (Even the instructions in the MOOCs say so, and Google says that it is
the only supported version of Java). Even more than that, some of them will
tell you that you should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use OpenJDK, but use Oracle&#39;s JDK instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you have a pure &lt;code&gt;amd64&lt;/code&gt; system and you try to install the x86-64
version of Google&#39;s Android Developer Tools (ADT), you are going to have a
surprise: you will have all sorts of programs telling you that you have file
not found, even though the required binaries are there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is, of course, besides install &lt;code&gt;openjdk-7-jdk&lt;/code&gt;, if you wish to use the
integrated Eclipse environment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out that the so-called 64-bit ADT/SDK actually has many 32-bit
executables(!) and they aren&#39;t statically linked. Inspecting them, I needed
the following packages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    gcc-4.8-base:i386
    libc6-i686:i386
    libc6:i386
    libgcc1:i386
    libstdc++6:i386
    zlib1g:i386
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth observing that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;libstdc++6:i386&lt;/code&gt; depends (transitively) on &lt;code&gt;libc6:i386&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;libgcc1:i386&lt;/code&gt;,
and &lt;code&gt;gcc-4.8-base:i386&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;zlib1g:i386&lt;/code&gt; depends (transitively) on &lt;code&gt;libc6:i386&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;libgcc1:i386&lt;/code&gt;, and
&lt;code&gt;gcc-4.8-base:i386&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the above, and given that the version of the GCC libraries can vary a
lot, it is perhaps better to simply do something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt-get install libstdc++6:i386 zlib1g:i386
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not necessary, since you are using an amd64 machine, your computer
already supports many more recent instructions that will be used if you
install the package &lt;code&gt;libc6-i686:i386&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid the emulator from spitting out error messages related to &lt;code&gt;libGL.so&lt;/code&gt;,
install &lt;code&gt;libgl1-mesa-dev&lt;/code&gt; (note: &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;i386&lt;/code&gt; here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, you will be able to run the embedded QEMU with full KVM
acceleration if you pass the options &lt;code&gt;-qemu -m 1024 -enable-kvm&lt;/code&gt; on
Eclipse&#39;s &quot;Run &gt; Run Configurations... &gt; Target &gt; Additional Emulator
Command Line Options&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, you are probably good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Just when I thought that I had enough things to play with, I
discovered some great tools on the &#39;net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of this (and what consumed me a good amount of time) is
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/pkfix-helper/&quot;&gt;pkfix-helper&lt;/a&gt;,
an auxiliary script for
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/pkfix/&quot;&gt;pkfix&lt;/a&gt; that
guesses the fonts used by old PostScript documents generated by
dvips with fonts that are scalable and that are much better to
transform to PDF format than bitmapped fonts. I even got some time
to write about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkfix&quot;&gt;pkfix&lt;/a&gt; so that
people get a better idea of what it is all about (the previous
version of the document was quite bad).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tool that I&#39;ve been playing with are mind-mappers. One from
KDE (which I can&#39;t recall right now) and one implemented in Java,
called &lt;a href=&quot;http://freemind.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Freemind&lt;/a&gt;. Using those
tools is quite fun and you also get a better idea of what you have
to do (say, using them as a task planner). Interesting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&#39;t understand why it is listed in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s contrib section, while it is
Free Software and its dependencies seem to be fulfiled with Free
Software only (remember that Java has, now, Free virtual
Machines).&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend had some complications in her biopsy and I had to
play the nurse role. Deinfecting the place and going with her to
the medical service was the next step. Actually, she went to a
vascular physician and to a general physician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After she was medicated, we went to the bank and I was there to
learn some things about the private social security system of
Brazil, with two plans: VGBL and PGBL. They seem like a reasonable
thing to use, but I fear that I will need the money in less time
than what was told me that I have to keep it there for not having
to pay a huge amount of taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, talking about taxes, I installed the Brazilian tax program,
written in Java, since I don&#39;t have Windows. Surprisingly, it
doesn&#39;t play well with openjdk-6-jre, which is quite amusing.
Falling back to the non-free jre 5.0 did the job, but this makes me
think that SERPRO (I think that this is the department responsible
for writing the programs) didn&#39;t really grasp the meaning of
&quot;portability&quot;: they are only delivering binaries for Linux x86. No
amd64, powerpc and other architectures. What a shame.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oh, I forgot to say: the multithreaded applications work quite well
with the Free Java implementations available in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/releases/testing&quot;&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt; distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mom&#39;s birthday. And a nice opportunity to see some relatives here.
Quite nice to have all them together. And it wasn&#39;t free of
surprising things. Something that once would be attached to geeks
was actually the subject of conversations for a moment: the use of
Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some sense, I feel that being the pioneer of the family to have
used Internet was interesting. But, then, motivated by the recent
surgery that I &quot;survived&quot;, made me see things in a quite different
fashion: using the Internet and computers like there&#39;s no tomorrow
is a pure waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the Internet is slowly turning into the new TV. There
are obvious differences, because you are in command of (some)
things, but, to be honest, I am not exactly sure that people are
that much in control as they think that they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I have started playing with Java&#39;s multithreaded
abilities. A nice way to play with them, but the book that I have
here requires a lot of patience on my part: it is a translation of
&quot;The Java Programming Language&quot;, 1st edition. The catch is that the
stupid person that translated it also translated &lt;em&gt;commands&lt;/em&gt; of the
language and names of classes! Is this a contest of foolness or
what?&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I have discovered that while Linus&#39; 2.6.12 kernel seems OK with my
IDE HD in the Firewire enclosure, both of Andrew Morton&#39;s &lt;code&gt;-mm1&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;-mm2&lt;/code&gt; trees are broken regarding the device. I posted to the lkml
and got some nice responses. That&#39;s one of the reasons why Open
Source Software is good: you can actually get in touch with people
responsible for fixing things without &quot;the middle man&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have been chaotically reading about &lt;a href=&quot;http://java.sun.com/&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;,
since I am excited by all the progress that the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaffe.org/&quot;&gt;Free&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sablevm.org/&quot;&gt;Software&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://gcc.gnu.org/java/&quot;&gt;Implementations&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://jikes.sf.net/&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; Java have shown recently. It seems that
the major milestone now is to improve the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/&quot;&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/&quot;&gt;Classpath&lt;/a&gt; project. Every
other JVM would benefit from a bigger implementation of the Java
API from GNU Classpath, if I understand things correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I said that I was chaotically reading about Java, I meant the
first edition of James Gosling&#39;s book (that&#39;s the only one that I
have here). Unfortunately, the translation that I have is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; full
of &lt;strong&gt;atrocious&lt;/strong&gt; errors that it is a disservice to an otherwise
fine book (even if somewhat outdated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and by chaotically reading things, I also meant reading about
how &lt;a href=&quot;http://subversion.tigris.org/&quot;&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; 1.1 works, so that
I can better manage &lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithms.berlios.de/&quot;&gt;algorithms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
