	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a burst of nostalgia, I decided to see what the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/&quot;&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt; had to say about my
first web presence. Unfortunately, due to the fact that my account
was mistakenly deleted by our former system administrator and then
recovered again, it didn&#39;t show me my first page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, on the bright side of things, I actually found pages of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/19970803122922/www.ime.usp.br/~lymber/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20010428082758/www.ime.usp.br/~malmeida/&quot;&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt;
dating back from when homepages weren&#39;t that common: at about
1995/1996. Almost a decade ago!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in the very same fashion, I tried to find my first usenet
posts, that are stored now at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Groups&lt;/a&gt;. The earliest post that
I could find was dated
&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/byx6a&quot;&gt;21st of December of 1994&lt;/a&gt; (now more than
a decade ago), but I am sure that there were posts of mine that
preceded that.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;rant&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
Ugh! Discovered that the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.speedy.com.br&quot;&gt;ADSL service I was planning to sign&lt;/a&gt;
blocks incoming calls to SMTP and HTTP ports -- since I don&#39;t trust
anyone to receive and manage my e-mails, I had a plan of setting up
my own e-mail server. Fsck! If the providers can&#39;t get their
freaking job done The Right Way (tm), why do they prevent their
customers from doing it themselves?? It costs them absolutely
nothing. I mean &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also discovered that I&#39;ll have a class of &quot;Probabilistic Method&quot;
during my birthday and only this class. This means that I&#39;ll have
to endure hours of traffic just to get here to see the class and
then more painful hours to go back home.
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
