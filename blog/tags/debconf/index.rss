	<description>&lt;p&gt;Due to some real life impediments (including a beautiful one with just over
2 months of life called Daniel), I will not be able to go to this year&#39;s
DebConf, even though it seems that this DebConf will exceed many
expectations with the support that the governement of Nicaragua just
offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;thingsthatiwouldliketohaveworkedon&quot;&gt;Things that I would like to have worked on&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this means that I will not be working with some fellows that
may be there, like people from the &lt;code&gt;pkg-multimedia&lt;/code&gt; team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, as I am working on some packages that are not that well
suited to distributions (especially regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://handbrake.fr/&quot;&gt;HandBrake&lt;/a&gt;), it would be
highly productive to have a hacking session or two with other people
interested in having this popular and easy-to-use video ripper/transcoder on
Debian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to be able to talk in person with other people (including
&lt;a href=&quot;http://joeyh.name/blog/&quot;&gt;Joey Hess&lt;/a&gt;) about controversial packaging of some programs, like GNU
Parallel, &lt;a href=&quot;http://packages.debian.org/sid/parallel&quot;&gt;which I maintain in Debian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many things else that I would love to work on, besides helping a
bit with some of the still pending transitions of the the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian Fonts Task Force umbrella&lt;/a&gt;, meeting friends and other social
stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, well. I guess that working at home will be the solution for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Went to the Brazilian national Security Service, to see the status
of my sick leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I took some time and went to see
&lt;a href=&quot;http://tiagovaz.org/&quot;&gt;Tiago Vaz&lt;/a&gt;, who attended
&lt;a href=&quot;http://debconf9.debconf.org/&quot;&gt;this year&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debconf.org/&quot;&gt;DebConf&lt;/a&gt;, which I couldn&#39;t attend. I also
met his friendly partner. Well, both are so kind and I felt at home
at his place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took some small moments to perform a mini, private key-signing
party, so that we both strengthen our trust networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last, but not least, I got the package that Martin kindly sent
me via Tiago and I&#39;ll now start to play with it. I have never
played with an arm-based platform before. Let&#39;s see if it is not an
alien to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
