	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Busy day. Woke up as soon as possible to see
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/~jose/&quot;&gt;my advisor&lt;/a&gt; and decide the furture
of my Master&#39;s degree. Then, at almost 4pm, had a ridicule lunch,
met my girlfriend and went to a shopping mall with her. While I was
there, I was attacked by the capitalist bug and had to buy me
something. I was looking for some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ora.com&quot;&gt;O&#39;Reilly&lt;/a&gt;
books, but they were way too expensive (I was expecting to get a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://perl.ora.com&quot;&gt;Perl&lt;/a&gt; book or
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lpython/&quot;&gt;Learning Python&lt;/a&gt;, but
decided not to).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked to the salesman and asked if he had
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~damian/&quot;&gt;Damian Conway&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manning.com/Conway/&quot;&gt;Object Oriented Perl&lt;/a&gt;, but he told
me &lt;em&gt;&quot;the printing was cancelled&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. I told him that
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manning.com&quot;&gt;Manning Publications&lt;/a&gt; wasn&#39;t told about
that and got some garbage as a response that I didn&#39;t even make an
effort to save in any part of my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I had the mission to buy myself something, I got me
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blind-guardian.com&quot;&gt;Blind Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &quot;Nightfall in
Middle Earth&quot;. Wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish my day, I went to my uncle&#39;s store and got another SCSI
HD for the Powermac, but it was also defective. But now I&#39;m a lot
more confident that the problem isn&#39;t with the mac itself, but with
the HDs (the mac would boot with the HD attached and see it while
in MacOS 8, but trying to install it on the HD evidenced that the
head was hitting the platters -- tomorrow I&#39;ll be getting another
SCSI HD). Let me cross my fingers. If I actually install Linux on
it, I&#39;ll grab &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.penguinppc.org/~benh/&quot;&gt;BenH&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s 2.4.6
Linux and get &quot;my&quot; mac a fresh kernel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, NetBSD 1.5.1
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netbsd.org/Releases/formal-1.5/NetBSD-1.5.1.html&quot;&gt;is released&lt;/a&gt;.
I still can&#39;t get ISO images, though.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Oh, what a day! I was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; tired that I woke up at (almost) 5pm.
And, surprise: no light. Yes, a power outage. Anyway, my parents
weren&#39;t at home and I found a note that mom left on my computer&#39;s
keyboard telling me that they were shopping around. Then, I
discovered two new boxes at home: a brand new TV set and a new VCR.
The first time in 5 or 6 months that would be able to see my
amazing tape of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opeth.com&quot;&gt;Opeth&lt;/a&gt; playing at Milwaukee
Metalfest. Woohoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But without power, my main concern was to be able to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; anything
before the day became too dark. After half an hour (or was it an
hour?) trying to find some candles and fire, my parents arrived and
two hours later, I was watching &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot;. Cool movie,
BTW. Excellent acting of both Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson (mom
told me that I act like him most of the time -- is that
compliment?).&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Didn&#39;t really got decent sleep (I actually went to bed at 6am+, no
kidding) and woke up by 12pm to bring
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/~cris/&quot;&gt;my supervisor&lt;/a&gt; all the student&#39;s
programs. After everything was finished, I felt like a slave seeing
light and being free. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went to my girlfriend&#39;s place (after renting two movies -- one
whose name I can&#39;t remember but that had Bruce Willis and Michelle
Pfeiffer on the leading roles and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thematrix.com&quot;&gt;&quot;The Matrix&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which she hadn&#39;t seen)
and watched half a movie. Came home to (try to) sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a long time since I last updated my diary. Let&#39;s see if I
can get things up to date (and let me see if I can keep me
organized and productive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the day started quite a bit messy: my computer, for some
reason, didn&#39;t want to turn on. It was beeping with my monitor
telling me to check the signal cable. &quot;Humm... Time to buy another
graphics card&quot; (and just the thought of having to choose from among
one less manufacturer of video cards scared me). I checked my
mainboard manual and it confirmed that the beeps I heard were
indeed problems with my graphics card (it&#39;s obvious that I didn&#39;t
want to believe the unfortunate situation of buying another card).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having to use my computer anyway, I just removed my card from its
slot, and installed it again. Luckily, things started working
again. Whew! That was close! Anyway, I&#39;m now watching this card
closely. Very closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learned how to set up cookies with CGI scripts. Found out about
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipesource.com/&quot;&gt;an site with recipes (for cooking)&lt;/a&gt;
while having my daily dose of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slashdot.org/&quot;&gt;Slashdot.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps due to lousy system administrators,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iname.com/&quot;&gt;Iname&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mail.com/&quot;&gt;Mail.com&lt;/a&gt; is
not delivering my e-mails. AGAIN. Enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, I have to finish a take home exam on Approximation
Algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Didn&#39;t do many important things today, besides making a brand new
installation of Debian&#39;s sid/unstable to see how things were going
with the bleeding edge. It turned out to be better than I expected
(I had some problems experiencing unstable before, so I was
scared).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the nicest things are that it features XFree86 4.0.2 (with
the RENDER extension, since I have a Matrox G400) and that, coupled
with KDE 2.1/qt 2.3.0, makes it possible to use antialised fonts,
which make one&#39;s surfing experience much more pleasing, for
instance. If you are on the same boat, don&#39;t forget to visit
&lt;a href=&quot;http://keithp.com/~keithp/&quot;&gt;Keith Packard&#39;s homepage&lt;/a&gt;, as it
features a handy
&lt;a href=&quot;http://keithp.com/~keithp/fonts/XftConfig&quot;&gt;XftConfig file&lt;/a&gt;. The
only lowpoint of KDE with antialiasing is that if AA is enabled,
then you loose non-scalable fonts with KDE applications, which
means that you can&#39;t make konsole use a 10x20 fixed font anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/&quot;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;, KDE 2.1 allows one
to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.windowmaker.org/&quot;&gt;Windowmaker&lt;/a&gt; Dock
Applications, and this is a very welcome thing as I love wmifs. The
more I use KDE, the more I&#39;m impressed with it, in many respects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managed also to find some sites explaining Androgenetic Alopecia
and which are potential treatments for it. Frankly, I&#39;d love to not
have to surf these sites... And keeping with the surfing thing,
found a remarkable program called
&lt;a href=&quot;http://vtun.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;vtun&lt;/a&gt;, for setting up encrypted
TCP/IP tunnels. Handy for WANs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&#39;m keeping reading about Multiple Sequence Alignment, which is
getting more exciting day after day.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Well, I didn&#39;t go to my customer today, as I expected. I received a
call telling me that they wouldn&#39;t be able to receive me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think that today was a modestly productive day: I spent a
lot of time sending e-mails dealing with bureaucratic matters (like
the English proficiency exam, my quest in trying to get a financial
support for my studies and a status update to advisor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m really, really crossing my fingers to go to IBM&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.research.ibm.com/summerjobs/&quot;&gt;Summer Jobs&lt;/a&gt;, but,
sincerely, I don&#39;t know what they are looking for in people
applying for the positions. I guess that I should study more right
now.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Happy New Millennium! So many things have happened since the last
time I&#39;ve updated my diary and I guess that since I can&#39;t summarize
everything accurately, I&#39;ll just list what I think are the
remarkable facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have now put my new computer (a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amd.com&quot;&gt;Duron&lt;/a&gt;
600MHz with a lovely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asus.com&quot;&gt;Asus&lt;/a&gt; A7V motherboard)
to actual use. Of course, I made a backup of my older computer, so
that I was prepared for worst (read on);
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org&quot;&gt;Linux 2.4.0&lt;/a&gt; has finally been released and
it includes a lot of new goodies. While I think that it is still
not the right time to switch to the new version, it is indeed quite
tempting (but I&#39;ll resist that temptation, since I&#39;ve read a lot of
people complaining of data corruption with the new IDE drivers when
used with VIA chipsets -- and my motherboard features, guess what,
a VIA chipset, of course).
At the time of this writing (Feb 4th), Linux 2.4.1 was already
released, with many minor fixes;
A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/releases/testing&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt; of the
Linux Distribution that I use,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org&quot;&gt;Debian GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; is now getting more and
more functionality. It is ready for the new Linux 2.4.0 kernel, but
still under development (read: prone to break). Oh, why can&#39;t new
software be stable? In the mean time, I&#39;m using Debian&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/releases/potato&quot;&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;.
One week after I have started to use my new computer, my 40GB
Samsung drive broke. Ouch. Fortunately, I had taken backups of
everything from my old computer and any new data that I had on my
new computer was still readable. So, now, I&#39;m using a new 30GB
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quantum.com&quot;&gt;Quantum&lt;/a&gt; drive and everything seems to be
working fine again. Nice.
I am now reading more and more things about my Mastership work. It
will be in a sub-area of computer science called
&lt;a href=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//tags/study/../compbio/index.html&quot;&gt;Computational (Molecular) Biology&lt;/a&gt;. In
particular, I&#39;m studying now alignments of multiple sequences. The
theory is quite general and applies to alignments of sequences over
any alphabets, but the biological motivation is to study and
compare (sub)sequences of DNA and of proteins;
I must confess that while I was reading slowly in the beginning,
without much motivation, now I&#39;m quite excited about the subject.
It has really grown on me and now I see how much I still have to
catch up to read bleading edge papers (it is also surprising that
this area of knowledge has evolved so much in so little time, but I
guess that this is natural whenever there are economic interests in
a given field). Now, I want to learn more!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The last day of classes of Computational Complexity. I&#39;m both happy
and sad. I&#39;m happy because it was quite demanding, with loads of
homework. But on the other hand, the subject is so cool and I&#39;ll
certainly miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to buy Papadimitrou&#39;s book &quot;Computational Complexity&quot;, but I
must be sincere here and say that I&#39;m quite scared of the sheer
amount of typos and small errors that this book contains. Indeed if
you ignore those errors, then the book is really good. I guess that
it needs a beta-testing phase as it is feature complete.&lt;/p&gt;
