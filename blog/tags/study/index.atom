	&lt;p&gt;Whew! One of the longest homeworks that I&#39;ve ever had was finished
today. Programmning Turing Machines takes time.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;After a lot of time doing this Combinatorial Optimization homework,
I found out that a lot of my colleagues didn&#39;t even bother to prove
that their algorithms worked, while I&#39;ve spent a lot of time
finding algorithm invariants and proving that they were actually
maintained from interation to iteration. This is the Right
Thing(tm) to do, but it also takes a lot of time. What should I do
next time?&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Spent a good part of the day doing homework. Two of &#39;em, in fact.
One, due Monday. The other, due Tuesday. I&#39;m more enthusiastic
about Combinatorial Optimization than programming Turing Machines,
but both classes I&#39;m attending are cool. For someone that enjoys
theoretical Computer Science, that is. Amazingly, the theory is not
far from the Real World (tm).&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Tired. Tired. Tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that my Mastership will have something to do with
phylogenetic trees. But that is only a wild guess. I&#39;ll have first
to understand the seemingly (for a Mathematician, at least)
confusing problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still haven&#39;t received an answer for my e-mail to Ajato. So much
for a timely answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rb.doesntexist.org/blog//tags/study/../nectar/index.html&quot;&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt; is temporarily disabled. I&#39;m still
thinking where to host it (e-groups?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still listening to &quot;Classical&quot; Music today: Symphony X and Yngwie
Malmsteen&#39;s Concerto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, it seems that today I can order from The End
Records. Weird.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;My aunt&#39;s birthday today. Tried to call her, but who said it would
be possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that a customer of mine that was giving me headaches when
I tried to receive for a job that I did for him (interconnecting
his computers with other places) finally gave up avoiding to pay
me. Nothing like a good threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/~lymber/&quot;&gt;best friends&lt;/a&gt; (if not
the best) lent me some Vivaldi and I&#39;ve ripped everything and
encoded with a version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sulaco.org/mp3/&quot;&gt;LAME&lt;/a&gt; that
I&#39;ve packaged for Debian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/~jose/&quot;&gt;advisor&lt;/a&gt; and I decided that we
should start with my research. Now I need a subject.&lt;/p&gt;

Ugh! Discovered that the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.speedy.com.br&quot;&gt;ADSL service I was planning to sign&lt;/a&gt;
blocks incoming calls to SMTP and HTTP ports -- since I don&#39;t trust
anyone to receive and manage my e-mails, I had a plan of setting up
my own e-mail server. Fsck! If the providers can&#39;t get their
freaking job done The Right Way (tm), why do they prevent their
customers from doing it themselves?? It costs them absolutely
nothing. I mean &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also discovered that I&#39;ll have a class of &quot;Probabilistic Method&quot;
during my birthday and only this class. This means that I&#39;ll have
to endure hours of traffic just to get here to see the class and
then more painful hours to go back home.
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Humm... I fear that I won&#39;t be able to handle this
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/~yoshi/mac5775/&quot;&gt;&quot;Probabilistic Method&quot;&lt;/a&gt;
course at all. I haven&#39;t felt this lost in classes for quite some
time (the last time, as I recall, was when I was just entering the
University). Let&#39;s see what happens as things progress.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;My mind is getting (even) fuzzier: haven&#39;t got enough sleep all
these days (an average of 5 or 4 hours) and this is really not
sufficient for me. This can be attributed to the huge number of
classes I&#39;m now taking (6). Some of them are interesting, some are
not. And some were able to scare the shit out of me. I could be
taking yet another class if I were able to wake up on time today.
But I wasn&#39;t. I&#39;ll dump some of them anyway, but this week is quite
hectic. The problem is: there are still two days left for the
weekend, let alone the fact that I&#39;ll probably have to work this
Sunday. Oh, well...&lt;/p&gt;
