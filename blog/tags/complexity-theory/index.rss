	<description>&lt;p&gt;The last day of classes of Computational Complexity. I&#39;m both happy
and sad. I&#39;m happy because it was quite demanding, with loads of
homework. But on the other hand, the subject is so cool and I&#39;ll
certainly miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to buy Papadimitrou&#39;s book &quot;Computational Complexity&quot;, but I
must be sincere here and say that I&#39;m quite scared of the sheer
amount of typos and small errors that this book contains. Indeed if
you ignore those errors, then the book is really good. I guess that
it needs a beta-testing phase as it is feature complete.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I had the &quot;midterm&quot; today. I thought that while the subjects
covered were well chosen, it was not very well planned regarding
time. I mean, only 1h40min for all those proofs? A comfortable
period would be, say, 3h or 4h, but, then, maybe I&#39;m a
perfectionist. Maybe I&#39;m slow. Maybe both.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I&#39;ll have the &quot;midterm&quot; of Combinatorial Optimization.
It&#39;s not exactly a midterm, since it is considerably skewed towards
the end of the semester and I&#39;ll have 3 other tests until the
course is finished, but I guess that having this many tests is
actually better than having only two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m terribly tired, sad (I&#39;m not emotionally very well) and without
much motivation to study for my test. I have a reasonbly good grasp
of the theory, but some details of the subject didn&#39;t &quot;sink in&quot; up
till now and I&#39;m not very much optimistic regarding what I can do
until tomorrow. In particular, finding negative cycles efficiently
(i.e., in polynomial time) is still a mystery for me. I have some
intuition of why the O(nm) algorithm works, but I have still to sit
down and write a complete, detailed a proof. I wish I had time.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Whew! One of the longest homeworks that I&#39;ve ever had was finished
today. Programmning Turing Machines takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
