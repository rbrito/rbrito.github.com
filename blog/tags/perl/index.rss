	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the &lt;code&gt;m3s.pl&lt;/code&gt; script made by Scott Lawrence, and given
the fact that he doesn&#39;t care anymore about it, I decided to see
what I could do so that I could generate MP3 CDs that will play
well with iTunes (like if they were regular audio CDs, but with
huge capacity and without connecting to the network to fetch
metadata).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the script could really gain some improvements
and that having it up to date has forced me to remember some Perl.
I made a lot of successful, incremental improvements by
encapsulating the code and making it reasonably readable (even with
a language that people say that is only &quot;writeable&quot;, but not
&quot;readable&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implemented things inserting data into a hash and then using the
name of the types of the fields that have to be in the
ContentsDB.xml file to write the appropriate values, but then I saw
that what I was doing was quite silly and implemented things in an
easier, cleaner way. Taking care to have things encoded in utf-8
and escaping the &amp;amp; character when writing the XML file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original program used the &lt;code&gt;MP3::Info&lt;/code&gt; module to gather
information about the songs. This module isn&#39;t as rich as the
&lt;code&gt;MP3::Tag&lt;/code&gt; module (which is able to get track numbers, track
counts, disc numbers, and disc counts, just off the top of my
head). This &quot;new&quot; module is quite good and more flexible and that&#39;s
what I adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, to traverse the directory tree, I am using &lt;code&gt;File::Find&lt;/code&gt;,
instead of a home-brew solution to the problem. There is only one
thing left for the script to be finished: having it write correctly
the &quot;numerical path&quot;, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; likes to
call it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, remembering things about references, compound data
structures, object orientation, the use of modules etc. has made me
gain some interest in Perl again. I think that I will make some
effort and learn it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I just submitted my third patch for the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/&quot;&gt;Linux kernel&lt;/a&gt;: it fixes the compilation
(and recognition) of the MTD device of the Kurobox HD that I have.
Now, I am running a brand new 2.6.29-rc6 kernel (yes, yes, it is
brand new right now, but at the breakneck pace with which the
kernel is moving, it will soon be quite outdated; I will try to
keep the powerpc part of things in shape, though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last, but not least, was the fact that I was submitted to a
biopsy (the original idea was for it to be just a colonoscopy, but
I had some inflammatory process in my elbows and some material had
to be removed for analysis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t really think that I am finished with all these health
things, but I surely made some improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I lied when I said that the biopsy thing was the last one that
I would write about. I am in the process of compressing movies with
the help of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://divxenc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;divxenc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://xvidenc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xvidenc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://h264enc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;h264enc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; scripts to generate
videos that are appropriate for playing in some set top boxes
&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; getting smaller files (which means that I will make my
small NAS last a little bit longer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since I discovered how to register myself on the iTunes music
store, I am downloading some German Podcasts. Will I be able to
learn some German? Well, I dearly hope so. My only grief is that I
am desperately running out of space and I will have to rethink my
backup strategy to leave some room for things to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I also played a little with MacOS X Tiger on Intel and the fact
that my e100 card didn&#39;t work with Tiger out-of-the box. I had to
use a special kernel extension for this very purpose. The only
thing that annoys me a lot is that I can trigger kernel panics with
the JaS kernel 10.4.8 in a deterministic manner. Upgrading the
kernel to 10.4.10 made my system not mount some disk images (and
even &quot;real&quot; disks, like my iPod video). I should, perhaps, try
Leopard here to see how things are structured and to see the
changes that Apple has provided to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding some cutting-edge programs, I saw that some programs were
removed from Debian after the release of lenny, since upstream is
inactive or dead. Too bad. But the nice side of things is that
snapshot.debian.net is a terrific service to the community and I&#39;ve
compiled things from there and got excellent results. I think that
I may even create a non-official repository with some multimedia
programs (and this includes, say, a newer, multithreaded version of
mplayer and newer libraries). I think that I will submit some more
bugreports (like the Real Video files from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aduni.org/&quot;&gt;ArsDigita University&lt;/a&gt; that
can&#39;t be played).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one last thing: (this one is really the last thing that I will
comment now) is that I finally will re-record my audio (and video)
things on digital media, so that I can preserve it without the loss
of magnetic media. This is a time-consuming activity, but I think
that it is worth the effort, especially if I use an automated setup
like Audacity&#39;s noise removal tool. Or is it better to use sox for
this task? I guess that I will have to experiment a little.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, some progress on the PPC front. I&#39;ve just configured the PMac
to use the &lt;code&gt;imstt&lt;/code&gt; driver instead of the &lt;code&gt;fbdev&lt;/code&gt;. Due to this, the
X server is now &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; faster. In fact, the whole computer is much
faster. Before, it spent a lot of processing power just to update
the screen. Since it is not exactly the most powerful computer in
the world, those few moments indeed were important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very fast and now it is almost able to play AVI files with
MPlayer. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Mac is now very usable and I&#39;d even dare to say that it would
be a good workstation, were it not that outdated (well, if one
could find replacement hardware for it easily...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that&#39;ll end summarizing all the &quot;Mac Journey&quot; in a homepage
to save future souls enduring the problems that I&#39;ve experienced
(kernel configuration file, XF86Config file etc). It seems that
Linux running on PPC is indeed a quite nice alternative to paying
huge prices just for being able to run MacOS 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also installed the superb
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mosfet.org/liquid.html&quot;&gt;Liquid Theme&lt;/a&gt; for KDE2. It&#39;s
amazingly beautiful and quite fast, despite all the eye-candy. It
makes your Linux desktop seem like you are running
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&quot;&gt;MacOS X&#39;s Acqua&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the down side of things, I guess that I&#39;m just encountering many
aspects of Perl that I don&#39;t like. It&#39;s saddening that I&#39;ve spent
so much time and money (buying books) for something that I&#39;m not
really enjoying (but it&#39;s ok).&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of things going on. I&#39;m now even more sure that I do want one
of those &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ibook/&quot;&gt;new and sweet iBooks&lt;/a&gt;. They
are so sweet, come with a long-lasting battery, have a 1024x768 res
LCD, a Firewire port, a 10/100 Ethernet port, a reasonably big HD
and an ATI card. In my opinion, it&#39;s only drawback: it doesn&#39;t have
a PCMCIA slot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, what could be cooler than Apple now selling its
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&quot;&gt;new Operating System&lt;/a&gt; as the
&quot;World&#39;s Most Advanced Operating System&quot;, when, in fact, it is a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/darwin/&quot;&gt;Unix&lt;/a&gt; under the hood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tuxppc.org/&quot;&gt;runs Linux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;! Not only that, but
if I ever get tired of Linux and want MacOS X, I can have
&lt;a href=&quot;http://fink.sf.net&quot;&gt;it with the power of Debian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But well, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; another drawback. Nothing can be perfect. Of
course. These things are so damn expensive here in my country,
mostly due to the absurd exchange rates and to the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.receita.fazenda.gov.br&quot;&gt;huge taxes&lt;/a&gt;. Anything that
isn&#39;t obtained with the welcome, kind help of the &quot;gray markets&quot; is
so damn expensive (to the point of quickly becoming intangible).
Which means that I&#39;ll probably not have one iBook unless I go
travel and come back with one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learned a bit more about Perl. Became a bit scared with the amound
of things it does at run-time. Isn&#39;t there a switch for the
compiler/optimizer to tell it: &quot;perform only what I tell you and
optimize the hell out of this code&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Um dia um pouco in√∫til. Acordei mais tarde do que o usual (17h) e
fui ler os sites de costume (&lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/&quot;&gt;slashdot.org&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://lwn.net/daily/&quot;&gt;LWN Daily Updates&lt;/a&gt; e
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agestado.com.br/agestado/?rf&quot;&gt;Ag√™ncia Estado&lt;/a&gt;). A
prop√≥sito, eu gosto tanto do Ag√™ncia Estado (principalmente da
cobertura econ√¥mica, dos coment√°rios acess√≠veis ao p√∫blico leigo em
economia e do uso de poucos plugins nas p√°ginas -- muito melhor do
que a &lt;a href=&quot;http://noticias.uol.com.br/ultnot/&quot;&gt;concorr√™ncia&lt;/a&gt;) que uma
das coisas que eu mais gostaria de ver seria um canal de RSS com as
not√≠cias para eu usar em algum cliente
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ximian.com/images/screenshots/ximian_evolution/summary.png&quot;&gt;Evolution&lt;/a&gt;,
junto com a temperatura e resumos de outros sites) e n√£o perder
mais tempo na Web do que eu j√° perco. Entretanto, achar algo como
isto em algum site n√£o √© muito f√°cil em geral, at√© mesmo nos sites
que &lt;em&gt;fornecem&lt;/em&gt; os canais.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solu√ß√£o √©, portanto, fazer um script em
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perl.com&quot;&gt;Perl&lt;/a&gt; para transformar a p√°gina de not√≠cias
em um canal e, da√≠, usar o resultado. Fiz dois scripts, um para o
UOL e outro para o Ag√™ncia Estado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acho que eu tenho uma rela√ß√£o de amor e √≥dio com Perl. Hoje foi um
dia de amor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anunciei &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/~rbrito/listas/bio/&quot;&gt;a lista&lt;/a&gt;,
comecei uma leitura (desordenada) de coisas sobre Alinhamentos de
V√°rias Seq√º√™ncias e me toquei de uma coisa bem elementar mas muito
legal a respeito do algoritmo de programa√ß√£o din√¢mica (que eu acho
que j√° deveria ter percebido h√° algum tempo -- como √© bom
estudar).&lt;/p&gt;
