	<description>&lt;p&gt;Watched a tiny bit of the men marathon up to the point were the
African athletes won. This made me sleepy all the day. To make
matters worse, I woke up many times today. Noisy neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Election day today. It&#39;s funny that I thought I&#39;d have problems
standing in huge lines, but it seems that computers can indeed be
helpful to humanity. Everything was fast and no annoyances. I&#39;m
impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow may be a sad day for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.napster.com&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt;.
Like they say,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://gnutella.wego.com&quot;&gt;&quot;Hope for the best, prepare for worst&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.
This may mean that my ADSL may not be as useful as I&#39;d like it to
be...&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Today it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/~lymber/&quot;&gt;Alexandre&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s birthday!
Happy birthday, pal! Too bad we&#39;re not together today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally went to catch a flick: &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; (in Portuguese,
&quot;Premonição&quot;). It was supposed to be scary. Ok. Some parts were.
Came back home rightly after the movie was done (which means that
I&#39;d like to get home not so fast next time).&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spent a good part of the day doing homework. Two of &#39;em, in fact.
One, due Monday. The other, due Tuesday. I&#39;m more enthusiastic
about Combinatorial Optimization than programming Turing Machines,
but both classes I&#39;m attending are cool. For someone that enjoys
theoretical Computer Science, that is. Amazingly, the theory is not
far from the Real World (tm).&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tired. Tired. Tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that my Mastership will have something to do with
phylogenetic trees. But that is only a wild guess. I&#39;ll have first
to understand the seemingly (for a Mathematician, at least)
confusing problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still haven&#39;t received an answer for my e-mail to Ajato. So much
for a timely answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rb.doesntexist.org/blog//tags/life/../nectar/index.html&quot;&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt; is temporarily disabled. I&#39;m still
thinking where to host it (e-groups?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still listening to &quot;Classical&quot; Music today: Symphony X and Yngwie
Malmsteen&#39;s Concerto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, it seems that today I can order from The End
Records. Weird.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The nice thing today is that I have slept for 14 hours. I needed
that. And I still need yet another dose of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It stinks to see that
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ajato.com.br&quot;&gt;broadbrand providers&lt;/a&gt; don&#39;t know their
shit, when one asks them for it. When I asked them for some not so
standard technical details, the support got all confused (all of a
sudden the line becomes silent). Anyway, I could understand that
they don&#39;t provide me with a fixed IP (but what do they use? DHCP?
PPP-over-Ethernet?). I&#39;ve sent them an e-mail. I know that I&#39;ll
receive a &quot;canned&quot; answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reiserfs 3.5.25 is released and now I can upgrade my kernel to
2.2.17 with reiserfs and André&#39;s patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been listening to Vivaldi all day long today. Talking about
music, I want to order Agalloch&#39;s &quot;Pale Folklore&quot; from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theendrecords.com&quot;&gt;The End Record&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s on-line form, but
it seems that their shopping cart doesn&#39;t get anything included
when I select the album (am I using it correctly?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new Gnapster is released and now I can connect to the main
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.napster.com/&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt; server again. Woohoo.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, another week is about to begin. And I haven&#39;t slept today.
Yes, I&#39;m tired. Yes, I&#39;d like to be in bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &quot;Classical&quot; Music week. Beethoven&#39;s 5th piano concerto
today. Hummm! I love the first movement! Simply amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, what a day! I&#39;m getting a bit older today. Some kind people
have sent me some cards (and some e-cards).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the day began that way, I was pleased to learn that my
September issue of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxjournal.com&quot;&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/a&gt;
arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, it was so nice to see a birthday present in form of a new
kernel (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linux.com&quot;&gt;Linux 2.2.17&lt;/a&gt;) being released.
Hopefully it will make the feedback and VM system a bit easier on
the user (now, I just need
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linux-ide.org&quot;&gt;André Hedrick&#39;s IDE&lt;/a&gt; patch and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://devlinux.net/namesys/&quot;&gt;Reiser FS&lt;/a&gt; ported to 2.2.17). And
there&#39;s the news that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org&quot;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; may be packaged to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, now that Qt is being dually
licensed, which is übercool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day is not over yet and I just got my glasses fixed and now I
can see the world much clearer. Uh... If all days were like
this...&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t been having as much time to update my diary as I&#39;d expect
to have, but I&#39;m updating it in bursts as I can. Anyway, I strongly
suspect the world is keeping a secret conspiration against me. This
past week could surely be better. And to make matters worse, this
past night, just when I was going to sleep my brand new glasses got
broken. I&#39;m now using some old glasses and I can&#39;t see very well.
The interesting thing: I didn&#39;t even pay all parcels of my new
glasses. I just wish I didn&#39;t have this huge shortsightedness.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;rant&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
Ugh! Discovered that the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.speedy.com.br&quot;&gt;ADSL service I was planning to sign&lt;/a&gt;
blocks incoming calls to SMTP and HTTP ports -- since I don&#39;t trust
anyone to receive and manage my e-mails, I had a plan of setting up
my own e-mail server. Fsck! If the providers can&#39;t get their
freaking job done The Right Way (tm), why do they prevent their
customers from doing it themselves?? It costs them absolutely
nothing. I mean &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also discovered that I&#39;ll have a class of &quot;Probabilistic Method&quot;
during my birthday and only this class. This means that I&#39;ll have
to endure hours of traffic just to get here to see the class and
then more painful hours to go back home.
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
