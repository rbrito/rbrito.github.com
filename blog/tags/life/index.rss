	<description>&lt;p&gt;I have always thought that having flexible deadlines in MOOCs is important,
despite not having used them too much. Until last night, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course in question is Stanford&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://statlearning.class.stanford.edu&quot;&gt;Statistical Learning&lt;/a&gt; and they
adopted a policy of letting the students complete all the assignments of the
10 week course until the last day of the course, in March 21. Then, they
graciously extended the deadline to April 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were it not for such an extension, I would not have completed the course. I
sent them a message on the course forums this morning to thank them for
this, as this, in my experience, is not so common with MOOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reproduce below the message that I posted on the forums:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject: Thank you also for the EXTENSION of the deadlines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Dear professors and staff,&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I would like to thank you (of course) for the course, as many others have
  already. Despite not liking edX platform too much (preferring the UI of,
  say, Coursera), your course was an exception, interesting enough (and funny
  enough) that I sticked to it until the end.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;But I would like to bring attention here to a point that many may not have
  appreciated (or, perhaps, not expressed as clearly as I thought that it
  deserved), namely, the extension of the deadlines (and a uniform deadline
  for all homeworks).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;In particular, due to some unfortunate facts of my personal life, I could
  not work on the course at all in the past few weeks. In fact, I completed
  units 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the last 3 or 4 days and submitted my
  last quiz a few hours before today&#39;s midnight (at my local time, UTC-0300),
  and I still got a passing grade(!).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Even with my desire to finish the course, this would not have been
  possible if you had not graciously allowed for the deadline extension. I am
  sure that I may not be alone here in appreciating this extension (even
  though I think that I may be many standard deviations from the mean, doing
  the homework and R programs of 7 weeks in only 4 days).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Thank you so very much for everything (including this extension!),&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Rogério Brito.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend I received my 17th certification (or Statement of
Accomplishment) for MOOCs. In particular, this last MOOC that I took was
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/course/androidapps101&quot;&gt;Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps&lt;/a&gt;, offered by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/instructor/lawrenceangrave&quot;&gt;Lawrence Angrave&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/illinois&quot;&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I certainly knew that the course was an Introduction to Programming,
the reasons I took it were twofold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &quot;novelty&quot; (for me, at least) of writing some Android Apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reacquaint myself with Java, which I have not touched since 1999, when
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbrito/old-projects&quot;&gt;I wrote a compiler&lt;/a&gt;, in the ages of JDK 1.0 being transitioned to
JDK 1.1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the time the course took (and which I invested in) was really
well spent. In fact, I learned some nice things which I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have
touched otherwise. For instance, I made the conscious effort to use an IDE
(Eclipse), despite being a person that would do most of the things inside
Emacs and compile the programs with command-line tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being huge, Eclipse has some really nice features and the
auto-completion is amazing. Since Java is so strongly typed and Eclipse
knows Java pretty well, it almost completely writes your programs for you.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, my interest also made me want to streamline the build process and
use the command line tools (with ant, another tool that was &quot;alien&quot; to me,
having used makefiles for everything that I needed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Eclipse (and the Android development environment in general) in
my Debian unstable computers
&lt;a href=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//posts/2014-01-17-developing_for_android_with_debian/&quot;&gt;was not&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.debian.org/734674&quot;&gt;without problems&lt;/a&gt;, but after spending more time trying to fix Eclipse
than really doing the homework (and pulling the little hair that I still
have left), one really helpful post &lt;a href=&quot;http://aleksz-programming.blogspot.com/2013/03/eclipse-and-webkit-on-ubuntu-64.html&quot;&gt;nailed it&lt;/a&gt;. (Yes, I had to remove
other packages like gimp, but such is life).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While playing with the Android side of things, I put one badly written (and
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; really &quot;android-ish&quot;) app in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbrito/toy-android-apps&quot;&gt;a github repository&lt;/a&gt; (which I think
is aptly named &quot;Toy Android Apps&quot;), which served me the purpose of learning
some Android-specific concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the course was helpful not only to get in touch with the tools (Eclipse,
ant, running Android virtual machines with the help of kvm), but also on the
Java side. I lost a bit of the prejudice against it (even though I still
think it is a verbose language, especially when compared to, say Python),
and I, also intend to contribute to one apache project or another that have
low-hanging fruits.  Actually, I have signed their
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt&quot;&gt;Contributor License Agreement&lt;/a&gt; and I even had
&lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;amp;revision=1559792&quot;&gt;my first patch accepted&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside: Well, sadly SVN doesn&#39;t support different committer and author fields
like git does and it seems that doing many small commits may not be the
Apache way of doing things&amp;mdash;but the important part of all this is that
the code is there and there is so much more to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside #2: After a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time spent converting the repository to git
(which is, after all, what I use), I put &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbrito/commons-graph&quot;&gt;a mirror&lt;/a&gt; of Apache&#39;s the
commons graph project.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Didn&#39;t sleep too much today (actually I spent the whole night awake
trying to understand the simple program presented on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; for the generation of the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_series&quot;&gt;Farey Series&lt;/a&gt; (as Hardy
&amp;amp; Wright call them). Finally, looking at my copy of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics&quot;&gt;&quot;Concrete Mathematics&quot;&lt;/a&gt;,
I discovered a &quot;bonus problem&quot; (read: a very hard problem) that has
a deceivingly simple solution that I was looking for the past few
days to justify the program correctness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latter, I went with my dad to &quot;Galeria do Rock&quot; to grab myself a
copy of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_of_Salvation&quot;&gt;Pain of Salvation&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
&quot;Be&quot; (DVD+CD),
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristania_(band)&quot;&gt;Tristania&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
&quot;Widow&#39;s Weeds&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opeth&quot;&gt;Opeth&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverance_(Opeth_album)&quot;&gt;&quot;Deliverance&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Went to the university prepared to give a talk in the Error
Correcting Codes seminar, but it was apparently cancelled due to
the fact that there wasn&#39;t a speaker for this week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the International Nursing Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took the opportunity and went to the psychotherapist.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spent some time working on what to talk on the seminar in Error
Correcting Codes. Since the audience isn&#39;t that experienced with
programming, I will have a lot of background to cover like what a
simplified computer architecture is, what are the usual program
constructs in a high-level language, how the complexity of an
algorithm is evaluated, asymptotic notation, examples of some
algorithms relevant to this audience, like the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor&quot;&gt;greatest common divisor&lt;/a&gt;
by Euclid&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm&quot;&gt;Algorithm&lt;/a&gt; and
Lamé&#39;s theorem. Of course, it is particularly important to cover
the methods of multiplication of matrices like Strassen&#39;s
Algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m actually excited to see Dream Theater&#39;s releases &quot;Live in
Tokyo&quot; and &quot;5 Years in a Livetime&quot; on DVD. I guess that my
collection of their DVDs is now almost complete. So excited to see
&quot;5 Years in a Livetime&quot; that I had actually a personal problem here
at home.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Went to my University to go to the library and there was a seminar
there. I stayed after being kindly asked by the professor that
coordinates the seminar. &lt;code&gt;:-)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I decided that it would be nice to go to the library to
visit once more the section of Number Theory. I was aware that
Diophantine equations were important. But I just didn&#39;t know that
elliptic curves are Diophantine equations. And the subject is
dense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, talking about Number Theory, I&#39;m starting to feel the
need of studying some Mathematical Analysis: the whole area of
Analytic Number Theory is alien to me and it shouldn&#39;t be (for a
person that aims at knowing the basics of Number Theory). Actually,
I can&#39;t even recall some basic facts from my calculus courses. I
think that it is high time for a refresher.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amigans.net/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=1410&amp;amp;forum=3&quot;&gt;Just discovered&lt;/a&gt;
what it takes to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mplayerhq.hu/&quot;&gt;mplayer&lt;/a&gt; play
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arrakis.es/~rggi3/youtube-dl/&quot;&gt;downloaded videos&lt;/a&gt; with
audio/video synchronized: the key is to pass the option &lt;code&gt;-mc 0&lt;/code&gt; on
the command line and everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did do something relatively &quot;evil&quot; today: I got my mom with an
account on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orkut.com/&quot;&gt;Orkut&lt;/a&gt;, so that she can find
some old friends of her.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;During he past few days, I have been writing (in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latex-project.org/&quot;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;, of course!) some (very)
elementary notes on Elementary Number Theory, after starting to
read the classic book &quot;Introduction to Number Theory&quot;, by Hardy &amp;amp;
Wright. The reasons for me taking such notes are threefold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To know how much I retained of the content of my studies and to
serve as a reference for future for facts that I will surely
forget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To provide a text that has a language different from the book,
which, while quite good, uses old-fashioned terms (e.g., they use
consistently the word &quot;aggregate&quot; for the word &quot;set&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To provide both some algorithmic aspects of Elementary Number
Theory that are usually not covered in similar texts (while there
is quite a lot of room for the computational side of things) and to
provide multiple proofs (where I know them) of theorems, which
serve to illuminate the understanding of facts and see connections
with other fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I got a phone call from a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; dear friend of mine. I
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.floresonline.com.br/&quot;&gt;sent her flowers and chocolate&lt;/a&gt;
as a birthday gift.&lt;/p&gt;
