	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I printed the first draft of the first chapter when my little boy
was here and he was impressed with this strange object called a &quot;printer&quot;.
Before I printed what I needed, I fired up LibreOffice and chose the biggest
font size that was available and let him type his first name by himself.
He was quicker than I thought with a keyboard. After seeing me print his
first name, he was jumping up and down with joy of having created something
and even showed grandma and grandpa what he had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He, then, wanted more and I taught him how to use that backspace key, what
it meant and he wanted to type his full name. I let him and taught him that
there is a key called space that he should type every time he wants to start
a new word and, in the end, he typed his first two names. To my surprise, he
memorized the icon with the printer (which I must say that I have to hunt
every time, since it seems so similar to the adjacent ones!) and pressed
this new key called &quot;Enter&quot;. When he pressed, he wasn&#39;t expecting the
printer on his right to start making noises and printing his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was so excited and it was so nice to see his reaction full of joy to get
a job done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of getting a spare computer, building it with him and for him,
so that he can call it his computer every time he comes to see daddy. As a
serendipitous situation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packtpub.com/&quot;&gt;Packt Publishing&lt;/a&gt; offered yesterday their
tile &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/python-projects-kids&quot;&gt;&quot;Python Projects for Kids&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, he does
not yet know how to read, but I guess that the right age is coming soon,
which is a good thing to make him be educated &quot;the right way&quot; (that is, with
the best support, teaching and patience that I can give him).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I printed the first draft of the first chapter and today I have to
turn it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, I am &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/&quot;&gt;downloading a virtual machine from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; to
try to install Java on it. Let me see if it works. I have none of the
virtualization options used, tough the closest seems to be virtualbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me cross my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I updated some of the tags of very old posts of this blog,
and I am seriously thinking about switching from [ikiwiki][0] to another
blog platform. It is &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;very slow&lt;/em&gt; on my system with the repositories
that I have, especially on my armel system. Some non-interpreted system
would be best, but I don&#39;t know if such a thing even exists. But the killer
problem is that it doesn&#39;t support easily the typing of Mathematics (even
though a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bk/ikiwiki-plugin-mathjax&quot;&gt;3rd party plugin&lt;/a&gt; for MathJax exists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I just received &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/telegram/status/927470283094499329&quot;&gt;an answer on twitter&lt;/a&gt; from @telegram and
it was nice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello, Telegram supports bold and italic. You can type &lt;code&gt;**bold**&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__italic__&lt;/code&gt;. On mobile, you can also highlight text for this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is nice that this works with &lt;a href=&quot;https://packages.debian.org/sid/telegram-desktop&quot;&gt;telegram-desktop&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that, I filed some bugs on Debian&#39;s BTS, responded to some issues on
my projects on GitHub (I&#39;m slowly getting back on maintaining things) and
file &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bk/ikiwiki-plugin-mathjax/issues/3&quot;&gt;wishlist bugs on some other projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I grabbed a copy of &quot;Wonder woman&quot; (&quot;Mulher Maravilha&quot;) and
&quot;Despicable Me 3&quot; (&quot;Meu Malvado Favorito 3&quot;) dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese
for my son. I have to convert the audio from AAC-LC in 6 channels to AC3 or
to stereo. Otherwise, my TVs have problem with the videos (one refuses to
play the entire file and another plays the audio with sounds of hickups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; After converting the VirtualBox image taken from Microsoft, I
could easily use &lt;code&gt;qemu&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;kvm&lt;/code&gt; to create screenshots of the installation of
Java.  The command that I used (for future reference) is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -smp 2 -net nic,model=e1000 -net user -soundhw ac97 -drive index=0,media=disk,cache=unsafe,file=win7.qcow2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;I have always thought that having flexible deadlines in MOOCs is important,
despite not having used them too much. Until last night, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course in question is Stanford&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://statlearning.class.stanford.edu&quot;&gt;Statistical Learning&lt;/a&gt; and they
adopted a policy of letting the students complete all the assignments of the
10 week course until the last day of the course, in March 21. Then, they
graciously extended the deadline to April 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were it not for such an extension, I would not have completed the course. I
sent them a message on the course forums this morning to thank them for
this, as this, in my experience, is not so common with MOOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reproduce below the message that I posted on the forums:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject: Thank you also for the EXTENSION of the deadlines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Dear professors and staff,&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I would like to thank you (of course) for the course, as many others have
  already. Despite not liking edX platform too much (preferring the UI of,
  say, Coursera), your course was an exception, interesting enough (and funny
  enough) that I sticked to it until the end.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;But I would like to bring attention here to a point that many may not have
  appreciated (or, perhaps, not expressed as clearly as I thought that it
  deserved), namely, the extension of the deadlines (and a uniform deadline
  for all homeworks).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;In particular, due to some unfortunate facts of my personal life, I could
  not work on the course at all in the past few weeks. In fact, I completed
  units 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the last 3 or 4 days and submitted my
  last quiz a few hours before today&#39;s midnight (at my local time, UTC-0300),
  and I still got a passing grade(!).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Even with my desire to finish the course, this would not have been
  possible if you had not graciously allowed for the deadline extension. I am
  sure that I may not be alone here in appreciating this extension (even
  though I think that I may be many standard deviations from the mean, doing
  the homework and R programs of 7 weeks in only 4 days).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Thank you so very much for everything (including this extension!),&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Rogério Brito.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	<published>2014-03-03T05:35:11Z</published>


	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;This weekend I received my 17th certification (or Statement of
Accomplishment) for MOOCs. In particular, this last MOOC that I took was
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/course/androidapps101&quot;&gt;Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps&lt;/a&gt;, offered by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/instructor/lawrenceangrave&quot;&gt;Lawrence Angrave&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/illinois&quot;&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I certainly knew that the course was an Introduction to Programming,
the reasons I took it were twofold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &quot;novelty&quot; (for me, at least) of writing some Android Apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reacquaint myself with Java, which I have not touched since 1999, when
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbrito/old-projects&quot;&gt;I wrote a compiler&lt;/a&gt;, in the ages of JDK 1.0 being transitioned to
JDK 1.1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the time the course took (and which I invested in) was really
well spent. In fact, I learned some nice things which I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have
touched otherwise. For instance, I made the conscious effort to use an IDE
(Eclipse), despite being a person that would do most of the things inside
Emacs and compile the programs with command-line tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being huge, Eclipse has some really nice features and the
auto-completion is amazing. Since Java is so strongly typed and Eclipse
knows Java pretty well, it almost completely writes your programs for you.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, my interest also made me want to streamline the build process and
use the command line tools (with ant, another tool that was &quot;alien&quot; to me,
having used makefiles for everything that I needed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Eclipse (and the Android development environment in general) in
my Debian unstable computers
&lt;a href=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//posts/2014-01-17-developing_for_android_with_debian/&quot;&gt;was not&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.debian.org/734674&quot;&gt;without problems&lt;/a&gt;, but after spending more time trying to fix Eclipse
than really doing the homework (and pulling the little hair that I still
have left), one really helpful post &lt;a href=&quot;http://aleksz-programming.blogspot.com/2013/03/eclipse-and-webkit-on-ubuntu-64.html&quot;&gt;nailed it&lt;/a&gt;. (Yes, I had to remove
other packages like gimp, but such is life).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While playing with the Android side of things, I put one badly written (and
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; really &quot;android-ish&quot;) app in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbrito/toy-android-apps&quot;&gt;a github repository&lt;/a&gt; (which I think
is aptly named &quot;Toy Android Apps&quot;), which served me the purpose of learning
some Android-specific concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the course was helpful not only to get in touch with the tools (Eclipse,
ant, running Android virtual machines with the help of kvm), but also on the
Java side. I lost a bit of the prejudice against it (even though I still
think it is a verbose language, especially when compared to, say Python),
and I, also intend to contribute to one apache project or another that have
low-hanging fruits.  Actually, I have signed their
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt&quot;&gt;Contributor License Agreement&lt;/a&gt; and I even had
&lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;amp;revision=1559792&quot;&gt;my first patch accepted&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside: Well, sadly SVN doesn&#39;t support different committer and author fields
like git does and it seems that doing many small commits may not be the
Apache way of doing things&amp;mdash;but the important part of all this is that
the code is there and there is so much more to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside #2: After a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time spent converting the repository to git
(which is, after all, what I use), I put &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbrito/commons-graph&quot;&gt;a mirror&lt;/a&gt; of Apache&#39;s the
commons graph project.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Didn&#39;t sleep too much today (actually I spent the whole night awake
trying to understand the simple program presented on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; for the generation of the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_series&quot;&gt;Farey Series&lt;/a&gt; (as Hardy
&amp;amp; Wright call them). Finally, looking at my copy of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics&quot;&gt;&quot;Concrete Mathematics&quot;&lt;/a&gt;,
I discovered a &quot;bonus problem&quot; (read: a very hard problem) that has
a deceivingly simple solution that I was looking for the past few
days to justify the program correctness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latter, I went with my dad to &quot;Galeria do Rock&quot; to grab myself a
copy of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_of_Salvation&quot;&gt;Pain of Salvation&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
&quot;Be&quot; (DVD+CD),
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristania_(band)&quot;&gt;Tristania&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
&quot;Widow&#39;s Weeds&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot;, and

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Spent some time working on what to talk on the seminar in Error
Correcting Codes. Since the audience isn&#39;t that experienced with
programming, I will have a lot of background to cover like what a
simplified computer architecture is, what are the usual program
constructs in a high-level language, how the complexity of an
algorithm is evaluated, asymptotic notation, examples of some
algorithms relevant to this audience, like the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor&quot;&gt;greatest common divisor&lt;/a&gt;
by Euclid&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm&quot;&gt;Algorithm&lt;/a&gt; and
Lamé&#39;s theorem. Of course, it is particularly important to cover
the methods of multiplication of matrices like Strassen&#39;s
Algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Went to my University to go to the library and there was a seminar
there. I stayed after being kindly asked by the professor that
coordinates the seminar. &lt;code&gt;:-)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I decided that it would be nice to go to the library to
visit once more the section of Number Theory. I was aware that
Diophantine equations were important. But I just didn&#39;t know that
elliptic curves are Diophantine equations. And the subject is
dense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, talking about Number Theory, I&#39;m starting to feel the
need of studying some Mathematical Analysis: the whole area of
Analytic Number Theory is alien to me and it shouldn&#39;t be (for a
person that aims at knowing the basics of Number Theory). Actually,
I can&#39;t even recall some basic facts from my calculus courses. I
think that it is high time for a refresher.&lt;/p&gt;
