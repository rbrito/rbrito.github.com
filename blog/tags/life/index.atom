	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;I have always thought that having flexible deadlines in MOOCs is important,
despite not having used them too much. Until last night, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course in question is Stanford&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://statlearning.class.stanford.edu&quot;&gt;Statistical Learning&lt;/a&gt; and they
adopted a policy of letting the students complete all the assignments of the
10 week course until the last day of the course, in March 21. Then, they
graciously extended the deadline to April 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were it not for such an extension, I would not have completed the course. I
sent them a message on the course forums this morning to thank them for
this, as this, in my experience, is not so common with MOOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reproduce below the message that I posted on the forums:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject: Thank you also for the EXTENSION of the deadlines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Dear professors and staff,&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I would like to thank you (of course) for the course, as many others have
  already. Despite not liking edX platform too much (preferring the UI of,
  say, Coursera), your course was an exception, interesting enough (and funny
  enough) that I sticked to it until the end.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;But I would like to bring attention here to a point that many may not have
  appreciated (or, perhaps, not expressed as clearly as I thought that it
  deserved), namely, the extension of the deadlines (and a uniform deadline
  for all homeworks).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;In particular, due to some unfortunate facts of my personal life, I could
  not work on the course at all in the past few weeks. In fact, I completed
  units 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the last 3 or 4 days and submitted my
  last quiz a few hours before today&#39;s midnight (at my local time, UTC-0300),
  and I still got a passing grade(!).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Even with my desire to finish the course, this would not have been
  possible if you had not graciously allowed for the deadline extension. I am
  sure that I may not be alone here in appreciating this extension (even
  though I think that I may be many standard deviations from the mean, doing
  the homework and R programs of 7 weeks in only 4 days).&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Thank you so very much for everything (including this extension!),&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Rogério Brito.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;This weekend I received my 17th certification (or Statement of
Accomplishment) for MOOCs. In particular, this last MOOC that I took was
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/course/androidapps101&quot;&gt;Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps&lt;/a&gt;, offered by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/instructor/lawrenceangrave&quot;&gt;Lawrence Angrave&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/illinois&quot;&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I certainly knew that the course was an Introduction to Programming,
the reasons I took it were twofold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &quot;novelty&quot; (for me, at least) of writing some Android Apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reacquaint myself with Java, which I have not touched since 1999, when
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbrito/old-projects&quot;&gt;I wrote a compiler&lt;/a&gt;, in the ages of JDK 1.0 being transitioned to
JDK 1.1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the time the course took (and which I invested in) was really
well spent. In fact, I learned some nice things which I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have
touched otherwise. For instance, I made the conscious effort to use an IDE
(Eclipse), despite being a person that would do most of the things inside
Emacs and compile the programs with command-line tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being huge, Eclipse has some really nice features and the
auto-completion is amazing. Since Java is so strongly typed and Eclipse
knows Java pretty well, it almost completely writes your programs for you.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, my interest also made me want to streamline the build process and
use the command line tools (with ant, another tool that was &quot;alien&quot; to me,
having used makefiles for everything that I needed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Eclipse (and the Android development environment in general) in
my Debian unstable computers
&lt;a href=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//posts/2014-01-17-developing_for_android_with_debian/&quot;&gt;was not&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.debian.org/734674&quot;&gt;without problems&lt;/a&gt;, but after spending more time trying to fix Eclipse
than really doing the homework (and pulling the little hair that I still
have left), one really helpful post &lt;a href=&quot;http://aleksz-programming.blogspot.com/2013/03/eclipse-and-webkit-on-ubuntu-64.html&quot;&gt;nailed it&lt;/a&gt;. (Yes, I had to remove
other packages like gimp, but such is life).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While playing with the Android side of things, I put one badly written (and
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; really &quot;android-ish&quot;) app in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbrito/toy-android-apps&quot;&gt;a github repository&lt;/a&gt; (which I think
is aptly named &quot;Toy Android Apps&quot;), which served me the purpose of learning
some Android-specific concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the course was helpful not only to get in touch with the tools (Eclipse,
ant, running Android virtual machines with the help of kvm), but also on the
Java side. I lost a bit of the prejudice against it (even though I still
think it is a verbose language, especially when compared to, say Python),
and I, also intend to contribute to one apache project or another that have
low-hanging fruits.  Actually, I have signed their
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt&quot;&gt;Contributor License Agreement&lt;/a&gt; and I even had
&lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;amp;revision=1559792&quot;&gt;my first patch accepted&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside: Well, sadly SVN doesn&#39;t support different committer and author fields
like git does and it seems that doing many small commits may not be the
Apache way of doing things&amp;mdash;but the important part of all this is that
the code is there and there is so much more to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside #2: After a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time spent converting the repository to git
(which is, after all, what I use), I put &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbrito/commons-graph&quot;&gt;a mirror&lt;/a&gt; of Apache&#39;s the
commons graph project.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;It seems that dad is with a quite fragile health. I hope very
dearly that he has a better luck than my grandfather and doesn&#39;t
need a surgery (since we would all be scared of that, anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got the material for the first series of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/&quot;&gt;Deutsche Welle&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/dw/0,2142,2595,00.html&quot;&gt;&quot;Deutsch: Warum Nicht?&quot;&lt;/a&gt;
course (which I had already printed) bound. It will be much better
to follow the stories and exercises this way.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Got sick and went to the hospital. Unfortunately, I could&#39;t go to
work. This has possibly messed with my schedule, but what exactly
could I do? I&#39;m voiceless and the medications that I took gave me
allergic reactions. These times have been a bit unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still have to go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/&quot;&gt;IME&lt;/a&gt; to study Abstract
Algebra (in an undergraduate level, but who cares?), get the last
parcel of my payment and the finals of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ime.usp.br/~rbrito/verao/2006&quot;&gt;the Summer Course&lt;/a&gt;
(which I have to grade soon).&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Due to the accident of yesterday, today I decided to take pictures
of my car, just as a proof of the damage made by mad freshmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine has kindly helped with her camera and taking
pictures of the car. They are just scary. I just get the feeling
that I am living among wild, savage people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a neighbour of mine has kindly lent me his
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samsung.com/&quot;&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samsungcamera.com/&quot;&gt;still camera&lt;/a&gt; for me to take some
extra pictures, before going to the police. It is a Digimax A302,
with capacity of 3.2 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that, now, the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macdevcenter.com/lpt/a/2849&quot;&gt;Top Ten Digital Photography Tips&lt;/a&gt;
will make more sense to me (along with reading the manual of the
camera). Oh, by the way, it worked fine with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.16-rc3.bz2&quot;&gt;2.6.16-rc3&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
mass storage module loaded. No extra drivers needed. Nice toy. And
a nice operating system too.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Got a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flash.net.br/&quot;&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; connection. It&#39;s
cable modem and the quality is variable. I&#39;m still evaluating it,
though. Some problems like reverse-DNS not properly configured
comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the DHCP connection is &quot;authenticated&quot; by the
MAC address of the card. When I showed that it was so easy to fake,
the cable guy didn&#39;t even believe what he saw. Is this bad news?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My car has almost turned junk due to vandalism of freshmen that
just got into the College. Poor souls. They don&#39;t know what to
expect when they take classes.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Today, most of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnome.org/&quot;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt; 2.12 has entered
testing, which is good. Also
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openoffice.org/&quot;&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt; 2.0.1 also entered.
Let&#39;s see if it plays some presentations that I have here that were
&lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt; when played with OO.o 2.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugh! Paying through the roof for the mistakes made the other day.
An arm and a leg. &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/sad.png&quot; alt=&quot;:-(&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hooray! Finally the Nightwish torrent from their 2003-06-20 show is
complete. It was a digital broadcast show and the quality is
amazing. I only had this one on a DivX file, but now that I have
the real thing, I will burn this one. The only &quot;problem&quot; is that it
only uses half of a DVD. Is there any way of putting another show
in a DVD, without having to author it and destroy its current
structure? That would definitely be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Holy, shit! What a disasterous day: two car accidents in just one
day, mostly due to wandering around unknown and rainy places at
night (almost lost). This will cost me a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, to boot it, my heart had an accident too. Oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bright side of things, teTeX 3.0 has entered testing, which
means quite a handful of new features and packages.&lt;/p&gt;
