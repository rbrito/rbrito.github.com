	<description>&lt;p&gt;Another usual day, without much to say. I&#39;ve been struggling to use
my University&#39;s network, but the system administrators take so
little care of it... What a pity. &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//tags/unix/../../smileys/sad.png&quot; alt=&quot;:-(&quot; /&gt; My home system is in better
shape, actually (ok, but them I&#39;m a nerd that almost lives for his
computer and that may be an excuse, but I thought that it was a
prerequisite for all system administrators to be one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catch is that I have to use that network to access some
academic databases and doing it at sane hours is painfully sloooow.
Pehaps other people are giving it more important uses, like
Napster.&lt;/p&gt;
