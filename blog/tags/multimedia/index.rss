	<description>&lt;p&gt;Roughly sorted by quality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;amr_nb in 3gpp &amp;lt; amr_wb in 3gpp &amp;lt; aac_lc in m4a &amp;lt; aac+ in m4a (only in Android 4.0+) &amp;lt; opus in webm (only in android 5+) &amp;lt; pcm in wav (only in android 4.1+)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking into consideration the compatibility of the codecs (mainly with
Android and with the popular WhatsApp and Telegram messengers), the best
options seem to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;aac_lc in m4a &amp;lt; aac+ in m4a (API &amp;gt;= 16) &amp;lt; vorbis/opus in webm (API &amp;gt;= 21) &amp;lt; pcm in wav (only in android 4.1+)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a device running API 14, we can use something like this
(&lt;code&gt;MediaRecorder.OutputFormat&lt;/code&gt; constants):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For very low quality/very low bitrate/very long recording times, use
AMR-NB in 3GPP container.  Parameters summary: 8kHz and bitrate 12.8kbps
Works pretty much anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For low quality/low bitrate/long recording times, use AAC in MP4
container, with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;m4a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; extension. Works pretty much anywhere. Example
code adapted from:
https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediarecorder.html&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private void startRecording() {
   mRecorder = new MediaRecorder();
   mRecorder.setAudioSource(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC);
   mRecorder.setOutputFormat(MediaRecorder.OutputFormat.MPEG_4); // other?
   mRecorder.setOutputFile(mFileName); // end in m4a, for compatibility
   mRecorder.setAudioEncoder(MediaRecorder.AudioEncoder.AAC); // AAC_HE, if supported


   try {
       mRecorder.prepare();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       Log.e(LOG_TAG, &quot;prepare() failed&quot;);
   }


   mRecorder.start();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	<title>Some new Youtube-dl functionality</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//posts/2013-10-23-assorted_news/#youtube-dl&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; that
Youtube changed their way of delivering videos, with the use of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic%20Adaptive%20Streaming%20over%20HTTP&quot;&gt;Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP&lt;/a&gt;.  On top of that, they
started serving both the audio and the video in separate streams, which
meant trouble for downloader tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube-dl.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in that previous post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What does this mean in practical terms for users of youtube-dl?  Well, if
  you wanted to download videos in resolutions like the 480p (format 35)
  that I mentioned, then you will probably have to change your way of doing
  things, until a more automated solution is in place.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;You will have to download both the audio and the video and, then,
  &quot;combine&quot; them (that is, multiplex them) to create one &quot;normal&quot; video file
  with both the audio and the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And latter, I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, to download 480p videos (which I do for lectures and so on with
  other projects of mine, like edx-dl) I have to call youtube-dl twice: once
  for format 135 and another for format 140, since the old &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/question.png&quot; alt=&quot;(?)&quot; /&gt; format 35
  files are much smaller than the lower resolution 360p files (due to the
  former being encoded in High profile vs. the latter being encoded in
  Constrained Baseline profile).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, now, we don&#39;t have this problem anymore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new release of &lt;code&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/code&gt; brings us many goodies, including that it is
possible to &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; combine/merge/multiplex audio and video formats
that Youtube now offers separately (See the previous comments about separate
audio and video).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you want a 480p video in H.264 format, High profile, with 128kbps
AAC audio (this used to be Youtube&#39;s format 35), you can specify format &lt;code&gt;-f
135+140&lt;/code&gt; on the command-line and it will download both the audio, the video
and multiplex it with &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;avconv&lt;/code&gt;, depending on what you have
installed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides being convenient, this automatic downloading and merging makes it
unnecessary to write scripts to, say, retrieve all the videos in a playlist
that contains a lot of lectures (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPQgeAz264g&amp;amp;list=PLA58AC5CABC1321A3&quot;&gt;one example here&lt;/a&gt;, taught by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict%20Gross&quot;&gt;Benedict Gross&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version 2014.02.17 of &lt;code&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/code&gt; will be soon in your favorite mirror of
the Debian archives.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Looking for (Free) a Video Editor</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s suppose that you went to a show of your favourite some time ago and
you were able to sneak in a camera (well, in those times, cell phones
weren&#39;t able to record much more than 176x144 pixels at 12fps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, then, you suddenly found that some people uploaded (short) fragments of
that very same show to youtube and, collecting those, you may be able to
create a &quot;multi-camera&quot; version of the video that you can record to keep of
your memorable concert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multi-camera, in the sense above, is not the same as
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Video#Chapters_and_angles&quot;&gt;multiple angles&lt;/a&gt; (like some DVDs), but something like a TV broadcast,
where the stage is filmed by cameras positioned at some places and the image
that is broadcast is switched from time to time according to that who is
singing, or playing etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Dear Lazyweb, do we happen to have any Free Software (preferably already
packaged in Debian) that is able to help with the task of &quot;aligning&quot; (in
time) videos from various (different) sources so as to produce one
multi-camera video?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would my options be? I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e7IPeuK1tQ&amp;amp;lc=Zwz7xq5ANT43j64jh8zLRYCMVRnJQgINcgSOhf-5Ozg&quot;&gt;asked this&lt;/a&gt; on youtube for a person that
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e7IPeuK1tQ&quot;&gt;did exactly what I want&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e7IPeuK1tQ&amp;amp;lc=Zwz7xq5ANT6jkGhCF9g1RzmZAsFIGmYzChDJwqwovNc&quot;&gt;their answer&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Vegas_Pro&quot;&gt;Sony Vegas&lt;/a&gt;,
which I fear that does not exactly would be allowed in Debian. &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any comments are welcome, thanks, and if I am successful, I will upload the
final video. &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Due to some real life impediments (including a beautiful one with just over
2 months of life called Daniel), I will not be able to go to this year&#39;s
DebConf, even though it seems that this DebConf will exceed many
expectations with the support that the governement of Nicaragua just
offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;thingsthatiwouldliketohaveworkedon&quot;&gt;Things that I would like to have worked on&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this means that I will not be working with some fellows that
may be there, like people from the &lt;code&gt;pkg-multimedia&lt;/code&gt; team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, as I am working on some packages that are not that well
suited to distributions (especially regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://handbrake.fr/&quot;&gt;HandBrake&lt;/a&gt;), it would be
highly productive to have a hacking session or two with other people
interested in having this popular and easy-to-use video ripper/transcoder on
Debian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to be able to talk in person with other people (including
&lt;a href=&quot;http://joeyh.name/blog/&quot;&gt;Joey Hess&lt;/a&gt;) about controversial packaging of some programs, like GNU
Parallel, &lt;a href=&quot;http://packages.debian.org/sid/parallel&quot;&gt;which I maintain in Debian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many things else that I would love to work on, besides helping a
bit with some of the still pending transitions of the the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian Fonts Task Force umbrella&lt;/a&gt;, meeting friends and other social
stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, well. I guess that working at home will be the solution for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Preliminary support for webm in youtube-dl</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I just added some very, very preliminary support for web in &lt;code&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/code&gt; which &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes/2010/05/msg02694.html&quot;&gt;I uploaded&lt;/a&gt; to unstable some minutes ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, at least people will have some material (in, fact, a chance) to play with this format.  I implemented this because, so far, I was only hoping here that a player for this would emerge. I guess that Debian&#39;s ffmpeg/mplayer will take some time, but I was pleased to see that Sebastian Dr√∂ge to upload a version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes/2010/05/msg02596.html&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; that could use the new &lt;code&gt;libvpx&lt;/code&gt; codec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that, now, as a side effect of webm being widely available, more people become interested in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vorbis.com/&quot;&gt;Vorbis&lt;/a&gt;. More support (no, not &quot;alternative&quot;, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockbox.org/&quot;&gt;Rockbox&lt;/a&gt;, but straight from the manufacturers) for it in hardware devices will be sweet. Well, I can dream. &lt;img src=&quot;http://cynic.cc/blog//smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:-)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it seems to be time to shape up that local build of mine of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.jp/aoyoume/aotuv/&quot;&gt;aotuv&lt;/a&gt; tuned version of Vorbis with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.jp/aoyoume/&quot;&gt;Aoyumi&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s patches for libvorbis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exciting times in the multimedia world.&lt;/p&gt;

	<dcterms:modified>2018-04-17T10:58:28Z</dcterms:modified>


	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the &lt;code&gt;m3s.pl&lt;/code&gt; script made by Scott Lawrence, and given
the fact that he doesn&#39;t care anymore about it, I decided to see
what I could do so that I could generate MP3 CDs that will play
well with iTunes (like if they were regular audio CDs, but with
huge capacity and without connecting to the network to fetch
metadata).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the script could really gain some improvements
and that having it up to date has forced me to remember some Perl.
I made a lot of successful, incremental improvements by
encapsulating the code and making it reasonably readable (even with
a language that people say that is only &quot;writeable&quot;, but not
&quot;readable&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implemented things inserting data into a hash and then using the
name of the types of the fields that have to be in the
ContentsDB.xml file to write the appropriate values, but then I saw
that what I was doing was quite silly and implemented things in an
easier, cleaner way. Taking care to have things encoded in utf-8
and escaping the &amp;amp; character when writing the XML file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original program used the &lt;code&gt;MP3::Info&lt;/code&gt; module to gather
information about the songs. This module isn&#39;t as rich as the
&lt;code&gt;MP3::Tag&lt;/code&gt; module (which is able to get track numbers, track
counts, disc numbers, and disc counts, just off the top of my
head). This &quot;new&quot; module is quite good and more flexible and that&#39;s
what I adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, to traverse the directory tree, I am using &lt;code&gt;File::Find&lt;/code&gt;,
instead of a home-brew solution to the problem. There is only one
thing left for the script to be finished: having it write correctly
the &quot;numerical path&quot;, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; likes to
call it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, remembering things about references, compound data
structures, object orientation, the use of modules etc. has made me
gain some interest in Perl again. I think that I will make some
effort and learn it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I just submitted my third patch for the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/&quot;&gt;Linux kernel&lt;/a&gt;: it fixes the compilation
(and recognition) of the MTD device of the Kurobox HD that I have.
Now, I am running a brand new 2.6.29-rc6 kernel (yes, yes, it is
brand new right now, but at the breakneck pace with which the
kernel is moving, it will soon be quite outdated; I will try to
keep the powerpc part of things in shape, though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last, but not least, was the fact that I was submitted to a
biopsy (the original idea was for it to be just a colonoscopy, but
I had some inflammatory process in my elbows and some material had
to be removed for analysis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t really think that I am finished with all these health
things, but I surely made some improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I lied when I said that the biopsy thing was the last one that
I would write about. I am in the process of compressing movies with
the help of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://divxenc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;divxenc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://xvidenc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xvidenc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://h264enc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;h264enc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; scripts to generate
videos that are appropriate for playing in some set top boxes
&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; getting smaller files (which means that I will make my
small NAS last a little bit longer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since I discovered how to register myself on the iTunes music
store, I am downloading some German Podcasts. Will I be able to
learn some German? Well, I dearly hope so. My only grief is that I
am desperately running out of space and I will have to rethink my
backup strategy to leave some room for things to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I also played a little with MacOS X Tiger on Intel and the fact
that my e100 card didn&#39;t work with Tiger out-of-the box. I had to
use a special kernel extension for this very purpose. The only
thing that annoys me a lot is that I can trigger kernel panics with
the JaS kernel 10.4.8 in a deterministic manner. Upgrading the
kernel to 10.4.10 made my system not mount some disk images (and
even &quot;real&quot; disks, like my iPod video). I should, perhaps, try
Leopard here to see how things are structured and to see the
changes that Apple has provided to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding some cutting-edge programs, I saw that some programs were
removed from Debian after the release of lenny, since upstream is
inactive or dead. Too bad. But the nice side of things is that
snapshot.debian.net is a terrific service to the community and I&#39;ve
compiled things from there and got excellent results. I think that
I may even create a non-official repository with some multimedia
programs (and this includes, say, a newer, multithreaded version of
mplayer and newer libraries). I think that I will submit some more
bugreports (like the Real Video files from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aduni.org/&quot;&gt;ArsDigita University&lt;/a&gt; that
can&#39;t be played).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one last thing: (this one is really the last thing that I will
comment now) is that I finally will re-record my audio (and video)
things on digital media, so that I can preserve it without the loss
of magnetic media. This is a time-consuming activity, but I think
that it is worth the effort, especially if I use an automated setup
like Audacity&#39;s noise removal tool. Or is it better to use sox for
this task? I guess that I will have to experiment a little.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, so many things going in software-land that if I don&#39;t write
about soon, I&#39;ll probably forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing, of course, is that
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/releases/woody/&quot;&gt;Woody&lt;/a&gt; is set to a
(tentative) release on May, 1st. This is &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, newer versions of the following programs are available:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; 2.2.1,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opera.com/&quot;&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt; for i386 6.0beta2,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; 1.0RC1,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&quot;&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; X 10.1.4,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mactopia.com/&quot;&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt; for MacOS 5.1.4,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://fink.sf.net/&quot;&gt;Fink&lt;/a&gt; 4.0, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lame.sf.net/&quot;&gt;lame&lt;/a&gt; 3.92,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://chimera.mozdev.org/&quot;&gt;Chimera&lt;/a&gt; 0.2.0,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://&quot;&gt;woody&#39;s netinst images&lt;/a&gt; 20020416,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.videolan.org/&quot;&gt;vlc&lt;/a&gt; 0.3.0. And I still haven&#39;t tried
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/&quot;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; 3.0,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yellowdoglinux.com/&quot;&gt;Yellowdoglinux&lt;/a&gt; 2.2 and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xfree86.org/&quot;&gt;XFree86&lt;/a&gt; 4.2.0, to name a few (big) new
releases. And that&#39;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; all: soon there will be newer versions
of &lt;a href=&quot;http://xine.sf.net/&quot;&gt;xine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mplayer.sf.net/&quot;&gt;mplayer&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ffmpeg.sf.net/&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaffe.org/&quot;&gt;kaffe&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much (new) software, so little time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, somewhere, a Microsoft&#39;s spoke-person said something like
&quot;the open source people don&#39;t know how many things we have done in
Windows-land&quot;. Well, of course, MacOS X, Internet Explorer and
Opera aren&#39;t exactly open source. But the amount of new software
just released (or in the process of being released) is just so
damned huge. I guess, if he only knew (or didn&#39;t pretend he didn&#39;t
know) what the open source community did in the past days, he would
be ashamed of his comments. But then, again, it isn&#39;t uncommon for
people driven by money being, ahem, how can I say, &quot;dishonest&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
