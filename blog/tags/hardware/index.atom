	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I printed the first draft of the first chapter when my little boy
was here and he was impressed with this strange object called a &quot;printer&quot;.
Before I printed what I needed, I fired up LibreOffice and chose the biggest
font size that was available and let him type his first name by himself.
He was quicker than I thought with a keyboard. After seeing me print his
first name, he was jumping up and down with joy of having created something
and even showed grandma and grandpa what he had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He, then, wanted more and I taught him how to use that backspace key, what
it meant and he wanted to type his full name. I let him and taught him that
there is a key called space that he should type every time he wants to start
a new word and, in the end, he typed his first two names. To my surprise, he
memorized the icon with the printer (which I must say that I have to hunt
every time, since it seems so similar to the adjacent ones!) and pressed
this new key called &quot;Enter&quot;. When he pressed, he wasn&#39;t expecting the
printer on his right to start making noises and printing his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was so excited and it was so nice to see his reaction full of joy to get
a job done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of getting a spare computer, building it with him and for him,
so that he can call it his computer every time he comes to see daddy. As a
serendipitous situation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packtpub.com/&quot;&gt;Packt Publishing&lt;/a&gt; offered yesterday their
title &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/python-projects-kids&quot;&gt;&quot;Python Projects for Kids&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, he does
not yet know how to read, but I guess that the right age is coming soon,
which is a good thing to make him be educated &quot;the right way&quot; (that is, with
the best support, teaching and patience that I can give him).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I printed the first draft of the first chapter and today I have to
turn it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, I am &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/&quot;&gt;downloading a virtual machine from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; to
try to install Java on it. Let me see if it works. I have none of the
virtualization options used, tough the closest seems to be virtualbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me cross my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I updated some of the tags of very old posts of this blog,
and I am seriously thinking about switching from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ikiwiki.info/&quot;&gt;ikiwiki&lt;/a&gt; to another
blog platform. It is &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;very slow&lt;/em&gt; on my system with the repositories
that I have, especially on my armel system. Some non-interpreted system
would be best, but I don&#39;t know if such a thing even exists. But the killer
problem is that it doesn&#39;t support easily the typing of Mathematics (even
though a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bk/ikiwiki-plugin-mathjax&quot;&gt;3rd party plugin&lt;/a&gt; for MathJax exists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I just received &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/telegram/status/927470283094499329&quot;&gt;an answer on twitter&lt;/a&gt; from @telegram and
it was nice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello, Telegram supports bold and italic. You can type &lt;code&gt;**bold**&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__italic__&lt;/code&gt;. On mobile, you can also highlight text for this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is nice that this works with &lt;a href=&quot;https://packages.debian.org/sid/telegram-desktop&quot;&gt;telegram-desktop&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that, I filed some bugs on Debian&#39;s BTS, responded to some issues on
my projects on GitHub (I&#39;m slowly getting back on maintaining things) and
file &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bk/ikiwiki-plugin-mathjax/issues/3&quot;&gt;wishlist bugs on some other projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I grabbed a copy of &quot;Wonder woman&quot; (&quot;Mulher Maravilha&quot;) and
&quot;Despicable Me 3&quot; (&quot;Meu Malvado Favorito 3&quot;) dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese
for my son. I have to convert the audio from AAC-LC in 6 channels to AC3 or
to stereo. Otherwise, my TVs have problem with the videos (one refuses to
play the entire file and another plays the audio with sounds of hiccups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; After converting the VirtualBox image taken from Microsoft, I
could easily use &lt;code&gt;qemu&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;kvm&lt;/code&gt; to create screenshots of the installation of
Java.  The command that I used (for future reference) is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -smp 2 -net nic,model=e1000 -net user -soundhw ac97 -drive index=0,media=disk,cache=unsafe,file=win7.qcow2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Fixed some typos.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;In the past few days, I did quite a good amount of things. One of
the things that took most of my mind was to convert some videos in
a proper format for the iPod. At first, I thought that the format
of the videos would have to have an H.264 encoded video with
resolution 320x240 (without using cabac, which increases the
compression factor of the video) and audio in the AAC format with
bitrates up to 160kbps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, using Apple&#39;s Quicktime Pro 7, I exported a video from the
Dutch band called After Forever, which had the resolution bigger
than 320x240. This made me revisit Apple&#39;s site where the
specifications of videos meant to be played on iPods. It seems
that, now, with the latest firmware update, the iPod that I have
can play H.264 videos encoded with resolutions up to 640x480 (the
standard VGA resolution). Also, the bitrate doesn&#39;t need to be
restricted to 768kbps: some of the videos produced by Quicktime
(and which the iPods can play) have bitrates of up to 1500kbps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that I can now encode some of my videos that are in the
nasty WMV format to formats that can be supported in a decent
manner by Free Software system. I have, for instance, the
BBC-produced DVD called &quot;The Codebreakers&quot;, whose audio is in pure
DVD LPCM format (that is, uncompressed) and the space that it takes
on my hard disk is considerable (approx. 1GB).&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Today was a very unusual day: it was quite active and I didn&#39;t have
a day like today for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had slept quite late, since I was waiting for
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s Quicktime 7 Pro for Windows (on my
girlfriend&#39;s computer) to finish the conversion of a video from one
of Cynic&#39;s show from their reunion. It was a show that was webcast
by the Norwegian company nhk.no (if I&#39;m not mistaken) and the show
is superb (it was from 2007 and they even played a, then,
unreleased song called &quot;Evolutionary Sleeper&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing of it all is that even though we where using a
x86-based machine (actually, a Duron 1.3GHz on a board with a SiS
730 chipset), which supported even SSE, things were quite slow. In
fact, the show took 1 day and some hours to be completely
&quot;exported&quot; in the iPod format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that was noteworthy was that my GF had some CDs that
she had burned and that contained some audio files from a course
that she took some time ago. Since those classes are quite
important and they interest me, I would like to listen to them. The
&quot;problem&quot; is that they are in IMA ADPCM format which most car
players don&#39;t play. The solution, in this case, will be to use lame
with libsndfile1 as input and convert the files to the MP3 format,
so that I can neatly tag the files and listen to them on my (and
her) car player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is only the beginning of the story, since two of her CDs
were not readable on my iBook G3, dammit. I, then, took the time to
download dvdisaster on her Windows computer (first, the stable
version; then, the more feature-full development version) and I
left the CDs being read. Unfortunately, it seems that even
dvdisaster is having a hard time reading many sectors of the CD-RWs
(and, yes, I did wash the discs with abundant water and used a very
soft towel to get them dry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, another thing that I&#39;ve learned was that uTorrent is very
featureful. Apparently, much more featureful than Transmission. I&#39;d
say that its features are on par with Azureus (even though I have
not used Azureus for a loooong time, as it is Java-based and my
machines don&#39;t have enough horsepower for programs that are not
natively compiled).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the torrent to grab Ubuntu&#39;s jaunty alpha 3, so that I can
experiment with things to come (and the new notification system
that Mark has proposed. I actually liked it very much, but I am
eager to see it working). The only catch is that my GF&#39;s connection
is only 150kbps and things are &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; slow here, but I&#39;m getting
the image anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I woke up, I went to the proctologist. After that, I went to
see a friend of mine from the high-school days, that is now a
neuro-cirugeon, I had lost contact with him, but I sincerely hope
to get back in touch frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I went with my GF to the bank where she has her account to
see if he had some residual money from a nation-wide program called
FGTS. She did have, but some documents were missing. The worker
that received us told her that she could mail some of the missing
documentation via e-mail and we scanned the necessary
documentation, but the mails bounced. Bummer. At least, the trip to
the bank wasn&#39;t completely useless, since I saw that I have some
money on this FGTS thing and it was a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latter, I went to the local theater and saw that professors are
able to have a 50% discount on the entrance to see the movies,
given that we prove that we are actually active. This is a very
nice thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also saw the price of a new, Classic 120GB iPod. It wasn&#39;t
available on the store that I went to, but other store of the same
name has some units. I guess that I should see one. I was only
surprised to see that the 160GB model doesn&#39;t seem to be sold
anymore. Any reason for that? That left me puzzled, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the electronics store, I also saw a netbook from HP that was
sweet. Soooo small, so cute. I guess that I need one. It has a very
small form factor and it features a 1.2GHz VIA C7M processor. The
only things that made the red alert lights blink for me were the
Broadcom network interfaces: both wired and wireless, and Broadcom
is know to not be exactly that helpful with the Free Software
Movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I went to get a haircut and my girlfriend told me that
it was good. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latter, before going to her place, we went to my home just for a
little while so that I could see how the torrents for MIT&#39;s &quot;The
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Program&quot; MPEG1 videos were
going. Not good at all. Everything is stalled. I guess that I will
need to use this uTorrent thing (at least, experiment with it) so
that I can see if the downloads are slightly better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did something unusual: scanned a 3x4 (centimeters, of
course!) photo of mine (which is needed here in Brazil for quite a
lot of documents) and collated it in 3 rows, in a way that I will
have 9 pics. I will print two of them (and have 18 pictures) for
R$0.69 each, which is not a bad deal. My girlfriend liked the idea
and I will do the same thing for her, since she will need many
photos for her id&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we got the vacuum cleaner to clean up her place (mostly
the TV room) and I cleaned her fan (which was quite dusty).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, the day will be quite full and I will have a lot of
things to do in this endless saga. I hope to write more about this
hectic (but pleasant) week.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Had a quite happy birthday party here with my relatives. We took
some pictures and it was incredible. Got a beautiful red tie, got a
USB 2.0 hub (so that I can use it with the Kurobox, since it only
has a single port and I don&#39;t feel like hacking its hardware).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to the topic of my birthday, it was amazing to see my
people together. And the party had a very happy mood. It was
amazing. Thanks to you all, people.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Today I got a very nice gift from Charles Plessy: a Kurobox
Standard (or Kurobox HD) that he had laying there in Japan, but
which he didn&#39;t use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about it is that it comes with an instaler that runs
under Windows and that remotely connects to the Kurobox&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Got a little new toy that is able to run Linux very well, since I
brought with me two &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; Live CDs (of
version 8.04 LTS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It features a Core 2 Duo T7250 processor. It has support for its
1.3 Megapixel webcam out-of-the-box, since the webcam uses the the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class&quot;&gt;USB device Video Class&lt;/a&gt;
protocol. The only problem is that I don&#39;t know how to use mencoder
to grab a video from it. And its speakers sound is &lt;strong&gt;so&lt;/strong&gt; quiet. Way
too much quiet, even at maximum volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macbook/&quot;&gt;macbook&lt;/a&gt; that I saw used things
from Broadcom, which is not a company that likes Free Software.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Just discovered that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opeth.com/&quot;&gt;Opeth&lt;/a&gt; (or would it be
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/&quot;&gt;Roadrunner Records&lt;/a&gt;?) has
released a version of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(Opeth_album)&quot;&gt;Watershed with extra tracks and with a DVD documentary&lt;/a&gt;.
They have also released another special version that has
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKx5zrb0Z_0&quot;&gt;Porcelain Heart&lt;/a&gt;
played with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellotron&quot;&gt;Mellotron&lt;/a&gt;
(which brings orgasms to all the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock&quot;&gt;progressive rock&lt;/a&gt;
fans, like myself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also got my parents to sit in front of my old, trusty
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duron&quot;&gt;Duron&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;code&gt;dumont&lt;/code&gt; (in
honor of Brazilian pioneer
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_Dumont&quot;&gt;Alberto Santos-Dumont&lt;/a&gt;).
It is interesting to note that, while the Level 2
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache&quot;&gt;cache&lt;/a&gt; of the Duron system
is small for a low-cost processor (in reference to its rival
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeron&quot;&gt;Celeron&lt;/a&gt; processor, that had
a bigger Level 2 cache), it has a much bigger
(128&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiB&quot;&gt;KiB&lt;/a&gt;) Level 1 cache than
what I have in a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_D&quot;&gt;Pentium D&lt;/a&gt; machine: only
16KB for each core (at least for data; that&#39;s what my &lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt;
says). Surprising to say the least. And this explains why
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD&quot;&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; stood on the front of the
race during the Athlon (Thunderbird) days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding other architectures (I have
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC&quot;&gt;PowerPC&lt;/a&gt; in mind here), I&#39;m
not especially happy with them: my
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC_G3&quot;&gt;PowerPC G3&lt;/a&gt; lacks
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_processor&quot;&gt;vector instructions&lt;/a&gt;,
which means that playing multimedia files (read: movies) is
something painful. The problem is that I &lt;strong&gt;quite&lt;/strong&gt; like the iBook&#39;s
form factor and I have not yet seen anything that matches it yet.
Comments are welcome here. Yes, it seems that I am not alone here,
given all the frenziness about the surge of netbook computers, like
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_PC&quot;&gt;Eee PC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I setup my old sound gear on what is my main (desktop)
computer. It is nice to have a good sound whenever I am working
(well, whenever I am working lightly, as I need sound to be absent
when I&#39;m working hard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have, BTW, just found a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://vindaci.members.sonic.net/cbreak/projects/autotools/&quot;&gt;superb autotools tutorial&lt;/a&gt;
that starts with the egregious &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/code&gt; application. This
is a perfect point for reading more advanced documents on this
matter.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Upgraded my parent&#39;s computer from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s Feisty (7.10) to Hardy (8.04).
Now, some of the things that I&#39;m used to when using
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s sid are available on their
computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I can&#39;t avoid to use this opportunity to complain once more
about my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flash.net.br/&quot;&gt;ISP&lt;/a&gt;. If I weren&#39;t doing the
upgrade &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; early in the morning, I wouldn&#39;t have success,
as I am (right now), without signal from them. These outages are
getting on my nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some math related news, I finally saw a proof of the intuitive
fact the determinant of a 2x2 matrix is the signed area of the
parallelogram with vectors given by the column vectors of the
matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, my D-Link G122 (I think that that&#39;s the model) doesn&#39;t work
with the &lt;code&gt;rt2500usb&lt;/code&gt; driver that ships with the distribution: I can
see that &lt;code&gt;iwconfig&lt;/code&gt; lists &lt;code&gt;wlan0&lt;/code&gt; as having wireless extensions, I
can set the device, it can see the access point, I can enter the
WEP key, but it doesn&#39;t seem to get a DHCP lease from the router.
&lt;code&gt;:-(&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
