	&lt;p&gt;Tried to go to my university, to see a seminar on the Steiner
Problem in Graphs, without success (the traffic didn&#39;t let me
arrive). Came back home and decided that it would be nice to visit
my uncle&#39;s store. He was leaving early to catch the last hours of
this year&#39;s Comdex and I went with him (he gave me an pass).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its always nice to see all those exposition stands &quot;competing&quot; to
see which one has got the prettiest models. And it was also nice to
see that flat panels are invading the market, but I wonder how much
time it will take before they are &quot;purchaseable&quot;, especially for a
graduate student.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Woke up quite early with that kernel panic bugging me. I read the
documentation and the fix for it was to reboot MacOS 9 (which
wasn&#39;t as simple as it should, since MacOS X apparently de-blessed
MacOS 9&#39;s System Folder). Anyway, after reusing XPostFacto, the
PowerMac booted with MacOS X! Woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, seeing this OS booting on this old computer is quite cool.
Well,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=33385&amp;amp;cid=3607384&quot;&gt;apart from some severe usability problems&lt;/a&gt;
and slowness, MacOS X is an amazing operating system. The problem
is: it &lt;strong&gt;is slow&lt;/strong&gt;. It is slow with a G3 600MHz (100MHz of bus)
with 128MB of RAM and, obviously, much more so with a dual 604e
180MHz with only 64MB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, MacOS X isn&#39;t able to use both processors when it is booted
with XPostFacto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW#2, XFree86&#39;s native driver for Mach64 doesn&#39;t include support
for the XVideo extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also used the client-side of NFS and SMB on MacOS X, which is quite
easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Took the day to see how things regarding the old PowerMac
9500/180MP were with a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://people.debian.org/~branden/&quot;&gt;newer XFree86&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xfree86.org/&quot;&gt;XFree86 4.2&lt;/a&gt; doesn&#39;t support the XVideo
extension for the &lt;code&gt;imst&lt;/code&gt;t adapter, which is quite a pity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that I am not able to use
&lt;a href=&quot;http://xine.sf.net/&quot;&gt;Xine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mplayerhq.hu/&quot;&gt;Mplayer&lt;/a&gt;
to efficiently play videos on this computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see some things that make this computer slow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has a modest amount of RAM for today&#39;s standards (64MB,
which is particularly little for PowerPC);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s RAM chips are in an interleaved
configuration or not;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it had a faster/better supported video card (say, like a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ati.com/&quot;&gt;ATI&lt;/a&gt; Mach64), things would perhaps be better,
but this is just a guess. I don&#39;t know if the Mach64 sports XVideo
support under PowerPC, but perhaps the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://gatos.sf.net/&quot;&gt;Gatos&lt;/a&gt; project might help here;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have no idea why this computer, while having a SCSI interface
and drive, is so slow while it is using the disk. I see two things:
it freezes most things the user (that&#39;s me!) whenever it is writing
(reading?) anything to (from?) the disk and the transfer speeds are
quite sloooow. I wonder if this is a problem of the Linux SCSI
infra-structure, if it is a problem of the hardware or if it is a
problem of configuration. It probably isn&#39;t a problem with Linux,
since I also see the slowness with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt;
Classic (8).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, just for fun, I tried to install
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&quot;&gt;MacOS X 10.1&lt;/a&gt; on this old computer.
The catch is that MacOS X can&#39;t be installed on anything this old.
Well, at least, that&#39;s what Apple says. I had to grab a copy of
MacOS 9 (in German!) just to bootstrap the system. Then, using
&lt;a href=&quot;http://eshop.macsales.com/OSXCenter/XPostFacto/&quot;&gt;XPostFacto&lt;/a&gt;, the
installation was quite smooth (and slow). But with one gotcha at
the first reboot: a kernel panic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Just another common day. Attended the mini-course on
&lt;em&gt;Theory of Matroids&lt;/em&gt; (which just shown me that I should be studying
way, way more) and the seminar on Computational Biology.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Typed the remaining bits of the first lecture on the
&lt;em&gt;Theory of Matroids&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read about how one makes a bootable CD for Newworlds with mkisofs:
apparently, the needed things are the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;create a folder with &lt;code&gt;yaboot&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;yaboot.conf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vmlinux&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;root.bin&lt;/code&gt;.
I&#39;m not sure if &lt;code&gt;boot-floppy-hfs.img&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ofboot.b&lt;/code&gt; are necessary. I
also don&#39;t have an idea of how OpenFirmware knows that it is
supposed to load yaboot during the boot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkisofs -hfs -map &amp;lt;file\&amp;gt; -part -hfs-bless &amp;lt;folder\&amp;gt; -r -o &amp;lt;isoimage.iso\&amp;gt; &amp;lt;root-of-cd\&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sent an e-mail to the bastards at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxjournal.com/&quot;&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/a&gt;, complaining that I&#39;m
not receiving my issues as I should (and my subscription is far
from being expired).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discovered that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com.br/&quot;&gt;Apple Brasil&lt;/a&gt; is selling
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ibook/&quot;&gt;iBooks&lt;/a&gt; in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/br/appleensino/&quot;&gt;a promotion for education users&lt;/a&gt;.
Damn!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Got &lt;a href=&quot;http://mplayer.sf.net/&quot;&gt;mplayer&lt;/a&gt; working well in PowerPC (G3,
600MHz), with the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://ffmpeg.sf.net/&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/a&gt;. I had to use
-ao sdl to get it working. The video wasn&#39;t as smooth as with -ao
null, but it was OK, at least. I am under the impression that using
-vo sdl:x11 is better than using -vo x11, at least with the Rage
Mobility 128. BTW, it was also possible to play DivX 5 movies with
this setup (the new Star Wars clip).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USB keyboard and USB mouse work fine under Linux. It was just a
simple matter of recompiling the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/&quot;&gt;kernel&lt;/a&gt;
with USB HID support enabled (in my case, as modules). They also
work fine with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&quot;&gt;MacOS X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Well, some progress on the PPC front. I&#39;ve just configured the PMac
to use the &lt;code&gt;imstt&lt;/code&gt; driver instead of the &lt;code&gt;fbdev&lt;/code&gt;. Due to this, the
X server is now &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; faster. In fact, the whole computer is much
faster. Before, it spent a lot of processing power just to update
the screen. Since it is not exactly the most powerful computer in
the world, those few moments indeed were important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very fast and now it is almost able to play AVI files with
MPlayer. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Mac is now very usable and I&#39;d even dare to say that it would
be a good workstation, were it not that outdated (well, if one
could find replacement hardware for it easily...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that&#39;ll end summarizing all the &quot;Mac Journey&quot; in a homepage
to save future souls enduring the problems that I&#39;ve experienced
(kernel configuration file, XF86Config file etc). It seems that
Linux running on PPC is indeed a quite nice alternative to paying
huge prices just for being able to run MacOS 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also installed the superb
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mosfet.org/liquid.html&quot;&gt;Liquid Theme&lt;/a&gt; for KDE2. It&#39;s
amazingly beautiful and quite fast, despite all the eye-candy. It
makes your Linux desktop seem like you are running
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&quot;&gt;MacOS X&#39;s Acqua&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the down side of things, I guess that I&#39;m just encountering many
aspects of Perl that I don&#39;t like. It&#39;s saddening that I&#39;ve spent
so much time and money (buying books) for something that I&#39;m not
really enjoying (but it&#39;s ok).&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Today I finally got the Power Macintosh 9500/180MP with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian testing&lt;/a&gt; installed in a semi-decent
way: I&#39;m using BenH&#39;s 2.4.17-ben0 kernel which finally has the mace
driver working again. What does this mean? Well, it means that I&#39;m
now not confined to 2.2.x kernels anymore. A 2.4 kernel has many
advantages, especially, for the PowerPC platform. Among other
things, they are faster for the same hardware, have good SMP
support, the IMSTT pci card is recognized (which wasn&#39;t in the 2.2
kernels) and a lot of other nice goodies like a journalling
filesystem (ext3) etc.
Also got &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3/&quot;&gt;lame 3.90.1&lt;/a&gt; compiled for the
PowerPC in a decent way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collateral effect of having lame compiled for the ppc is that now
I have a have a good benchmark that shows me roughly how much
slower this thing is in relation to my Duron 600MHz. The sad news:
it is 5 or 6 times slower than the Duron. If lame were
multithreaded, then it could be up to 2.5 times slower, which would
be acceptable for day-to-day use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, got some work done to make the Debian packaging
scripts a bit nicer (read: closer to being lintian clean).
Unfortunately, lintian still complains about the shared library
package having an rpath and I don&#39;t know how to get rid of that
(not even a kludgy solution).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://mplayer.sf.net&quot;&gt;MPlayer&lt;/a&gt; released another version
(0.60pre2), I downloaded the sources and, to my surprise, it
compiles on PPC (the 0.60pre1 didn&#39;t). And it even plays, errr,
tries to play DivX movies! Amazing job these guys are
accomplishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After struggling a lot with the configuration files, also got X
4.1.0 working on a framebuffer device (the imstt driver doesn&#39;t
work). So, now I even have a reasonably fast, modest GUI working
(or a slower GUI if I load &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/&quot;&gt;KDE 2&lt;/a&gt;). And I can
even use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; here, although the
swapping doesn&#39;t make it a pleasant experience. In this respect,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opera.com/&quot;&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt;, while non-free, is much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this can now be a poor&#39;s man desktop machine. If it
only consumed power proportional to its speed, it would be nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
