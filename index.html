    <h1>Initial page</h1>
    <p>
      This is a placeholder to my other pages, since I am just moving from a
      flaky service to <a href="http://github.com/"><code>github</code></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am in the process of migrating my old wordpress blog to
      <a href="http://ikiwiki.info"><code>ikiwiki</code></a> and it is soon
      going to appear
      at <a href="http://rb.doesntexist.org/blog/">rb.doesntexist.org/blog/</a>,
      if all the migration goes well.
    </p>

    <p>
      The migration, for those interested, was made by a bunch of
      <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> scripts, many manual
      tweakings, and a lot of tweaking with <code>git</code>. I can post
      more precise steps later if desired.
