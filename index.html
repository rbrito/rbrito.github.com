      <em>
        For the Cynics, the purpose of life was to live in virtue, in
        agreement with nature. As reasoning creatures, people could gain
        happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which was
        natural for humans, rejecting all conventional desires for wealth,
        power, sex, and fame. Instead, they were to lead a simple life free
        from all possessions.

      This is a placeholder to my other pages, since I am just moving from a
      flaky service to <a href="http://github.com/">github</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am in the process of migrating my old wordpress blog
      to <a href="http://ikiwiki.info/">ikiwiki</a> and it is soon going to
      appear at <a href="http://cynic.cc/blog/">cynic.cc/blog/</a>, if all
      the migration goes well.
    </p>

    <p>
      The migration, for those interested, was made by a bunch
      of <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> scripts, many manual
      tweakings, and a lot of tweaking
      with <a href="http://git-scm.com/"><code>git</code></a>.  I can post
      more precise steps later if desired.
